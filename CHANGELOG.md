---

## [1.3.5] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

**🚨 CRITICAL Install Script Bug:**
- Fixed `bmad-install-agents` only copying deprecated workflows, not the 7 new workflows
- Fixed hardcoded version 1.2.0 (now correctly uses 1.3.5)
- Install script now copies all 7 Vortex workflows: lean-persona, product-vision, contextualize-scope, mvp, lean-experiment, proof-of-concept, proof-of-value
- **This was causing "folders are still a mess" issue - workflows were listed in config but never installed**

**What was broken in v1.3.4 and earlier:**
- Fresh installs only got deprecated workflows (empathy-map, wireframe)
- Config.yaml listed 7 workflows that didn't exist
- Version was always set to 1.2.0 regardless of package version
- Validation failed because workflow.md files were missing

---

## [1.3.4] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

**🔧 CRITICAL Migration Bug:**
- Fixed migration system not detecting migrations from 1.2.0 to 1.3.x
- Updated all migrations to target version 1.3.4 (was 1.3.0)
- Migrations now correctly run when upgrading from 1.0.x, 1.1.x, or 1.2.x
- **This fixes the "No migrations needed (versions compatible)" error**
- Now properly removes deprecated agents and legacy `_designos` directory

**What was broken in v1.3.3:**
- Users on v1.2.0 saw "No migrations needed" but weren't upgraded
- Deprecated agents and `_designos` directory weren't removed
- Version remained at 1.2.0 instead of updating to 1.3.x

---

## [1.3.3] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

**🧹 Legacy Directory Cleanup:**
- Added automatic removal of old `_designos` directory (pre-Vortex structure) in all migrations
- Users with installations from very old versions will now have the legacy directory removed automatically
- Migration preview now shows when legacy directory will be removed
- Removed obsolete `_designos` reference from `.npmignore`

**Updated migrations:**
- `1.0.x-to-1.3.0`, `1.1.x-to-1.3.0`, `1.2.x-to-1.3.0` all now remove `_bmad/bme/_designos/` if present

---

## [1.3.2] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

**🚨 CRITICAL Package Bug:**
- Fixed `.npmignore` excluding Vortex framework files from published package
- Agent files (`contextualization-expert.md`, `lean-experiments-specialist.md`) now included in package
- All workflow template files now included in package
- `CHANGELOG.md` and `UPDATE-GUIDE.md` now included in package
- User guides in both `vortex-artifacts/` and `design-artifacts/` now included
- **This was blocking all installations and migrations in v1.3.0 and v1.3.1** ❌

**Package now includes:**
- 113 files (was 27 in v1.3.0/v1.3.1)
- 116.1 kB (was 55.0 kB in v1.3.0/v1.3.1)
- All necessary agent and workflow files

**⚠️ Action Required:**
- If you installed v1.3.0 or v1.3.1: `npm install bmad-enhanced@1.3.2`
- Fresh installations now work: `npx bmad-install-agents`
- Migrations now work: `npx bmad-update`

---

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

**🐛 Migration Bug:**
- Fixed issue where deprecated agent files (`empathy-mapper.md`, `wireframe-designer.md`) were not being removed during migration
- All three migrations (1.0.x, 1.1.x, 1.2.x → 1.3.0) now properly remove deprecated agents before copying new ones
- Users upgrading from v1.0.x or v1.1.x will now see only the correct agent files
- Migration preview output now explicitly shows which deprecated files will be removed

**⚠️ Note:** v1.3.1 still had the critical `.npmignore` bug from v1.3.0. Use v1.3.2 instead.

### MAJOR REPOSITIONING: From Design Agents to Vortex Framework

This release represents a fundamental repositioning of BMAD-Enhanced from design-focused agents (empathy mapping, wireframing) to a Lean Startup validation framework.

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Renamed module from `_designos` to `_vortex`
- **BREAKING:** Emma repositioned from "Empathy Mapping Specialist" to "Contextualization Expert" (icon: 🎯)
  - Focus: Strategic framing, lean personas, product vision, problem space navigation
  - Role: Guides teams through the "Contextualize" stream
  - New workflows: lean-persona, product-vision, contextualize-scope (empathy-map deprecated)
- **BREAKING:** Wade repositioned from "Wireframe Design Specialist" to "Lean Experiments Specialist" (icon: 🧪)
  - Focus: Build-Measure-Learn cycles, MVPs, validated learning
  - Role: Guides teams through the "Externalize" stream
  - New workflows: mvp, lean-experiment, proof-of-concept, proof-of-value (wireframe deprecated)
- **BREAKING:** Output folder changed from `_bmad-output/design-artifacts` to `_bmad-output/vortex-artifacts`
- Updated all installer scripts to reflect new module name and agent descriptions
- Updated config.yaml structure to version 1.1.0 with Vortex framework metadata
- Updated agent-manifest.csv with new agent identities and expertise

### Added
- Vortex framework structure with Contextualize and Externalize streams
- 7 new workflow placeholders (v1.2.0):
  - Emma (Contextualize): lean-persona, product-vision, contextualize-scope
  - Wade (Externalize): mvp, lean-experiment, proof-of-concept, proof-of-value
- Version field in config.yaml for better version tracking

### Migration Guide

**For existing users upgrading from 1.0.x:**

1. **Module path changed:**
   - Old: `_bmad/bme/_designos/`
   - New: `_bmad/bme/_vortex/`

2. **Output folder changed:**
   - Old: `_bmad-output/design-artifacts/`
   - New: `_bmad-output/vortex-artifacts/`

3. **Agent activation paths updated:**
   - Emma: `cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/contextualization-expert.md`
   - Wade: `cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/lean-experiments-specialist.md`

4. **Workflows replaced:**
   - Emma's empathy-map workflow → lean-persona workflow (coming in v1.2.0)
   - Wade's wireframe workflow → lean-experiment workflow (coming in v1.2.0)

5. **Clean reinstall recommended:**
   ```bash
   # Backup any custom configs
   # Remove old installation
   rm -rf _bmad/bme/_designos
   rm -rf _bmad-output/design-artifacts

   # Install v1.1.0
   npm install bmad-enhanced@1.1.0
   npx bmad-install-agents
   ```

### Positioning Rationale

**Why this change?**

The repositioning aligns Emma and Wade with Lean Startup and validated learning principles:

- **Emma (Contextualize):** Helps teams frame the right problem before building solutions
  - Differentiation: Emma contextualizes (problem space), Maya creates (solution space)
- **Wade (Externalize):** Helps teams validate assumptions through rapid experimentation
  - Differentiation: Wade externalizes (test with users), Sally internalizes (test with code)

This creates a clear value proposition: Use Emma + Wade for Lean Startup validation, then hand off to BMAD core agents for implementation.

### Technical Details
- Module version: 1.1.0
- Config structure: Updated with submodule metadata
- Backward compatibility: NONE (breaking changes require migration)
- Package size: ~55KB (unchanged)

### Notes
- v1.0.x workflows (empathy-map, wireframe) are deprecated
- New workflows (lean-persona, mvp, etc.) will be fully implemented in v1.2.0
- User guides will be updated in v1.2.0 to reflect new positioning
