# FAQ

Common questions about BMAD-Enhanced and the Vortex Pattern.

---

### How is this different from BMAD core agents?

**BMAD-Enhanced handles pre-implementation validation. BMAD Core handles implementation.**

| Phase | Agents | Question answered |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| Pre-implementation (Vortex) | Emma, Isla, Wade, Max | "Should we build this?" |
| Implementation (BMAD Core) | PM, Architect, Dev, QA | "Let's build it right" |

The handoff: Emma → Isla → Wade → Max → BMAD Core.

---

### Can I use agents independently?

Yes. Each agent works standalone:

- **Emma alone** — Strategic framing and problem space definition
- **Isla alone** — User research and empathy mapping
- **Wade alone** — Experiment design and validation
- **Max alone** — Learning capture and decision-making

Use all four together for the complete Vortex flow.

---

### What's the recommended order?

Follow the Vortex flow, but jump in wherever you are:

1. **Emma** — Defining a new product or problem space
2. **Isla** — Know the problem, need to understand users
3. **Wade** — Have hypotheses ready to test
4. **Max** — Have experiment results, need to decide next steps

Max's Vortex Navigation helps identify which stream needs attention based on evidence gaps.

### What happened to empathy mapping and wireframing?

They were repositioned in v1.1.0. The project pivoted from traditional design deliverables to Lean Startup validation.

**v1.0.x:** Emma = Empathy Mapping Specialist, Wade = Wireframe Design Specialist
**v1.1.0+:** Emma = Contextualization Expert, Wade = Lean Experiments Specialist

Empathy mapping was later resurrected in v1.5.0 under Isla's Empathize stream.

---

### Is this the same as the multi-framework orchestration project?

No. The project pivoted from multi-framework orchestration (Quint + DesignOS + BMAD + AgentOS) to focused domain-specialized agents within BMAD.

The archived original vision is at `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ORIGINAL-VISION-README.md`.

### What's coming in Wave 3?

v1.6.0 will add the remaining three Vortex streams:

- **Synthesize** — Pattern recognition and insight synthesis across research
- **Hypothesize** — Structured hypothesis generation from insights
- **Sensitize** — Stakeholder alignment and organizational buy-in

This completes the full 7-stream Vortex Pattern.

---

### Are all workflows ready to use?

Yes. All 13 workflows are fully implemented:

- **Emma:** lean-persona, product-vision, contextualize-scope
- **Isla:** empathy-map, user-interview, user-discovery
- **Wade:** mvp, lean-experiment, proof-of-concept, proof-of-value
- **Max:** learning-card, pivot-patch-persevere, vortex-navigation

Each includes templates, step files, and validation.
