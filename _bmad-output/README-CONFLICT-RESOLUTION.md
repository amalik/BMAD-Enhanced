# README Conflict Resolution

**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Issue:** Two README files describing different project visions
**Resolution:** Archive old, create new aligned with current project

---

## The Conflict

### What We Found

Two README files existed with conflicting information:

**1. Root README.md (OLD)**
- **Vision:** Multi-framework orchestration (Quint + DesignOS + BMAD + AgentOS)
- **Architecture:** SQLite sync adapter, BaseArtifact contract
- **Timeline:** 24-week implementation plan
- **Status:** "Planning Phase Complete"
- **Size:** 2,700 LOC adapter + complex integration
- **Last Updated:** Unknown (appeared to be from early planning phase)

**2. _bmad-output/README.md (CURRENT)**
- **Vision:** Domain-specialized agents within BMAD
- **Architecture:** BMAD Agent Architecture Framework v1.1.0
- **Timeline:** 3-week implementation (Week 1-3)
- **Status:** "Week 1, Day 2 - Emma operational"
- **Size:** ~500 LOC per agent (~1,240 LOC total for 4 agents)
- **Last Updated:** 2026-02-14

### The Problem

**For external stakeholders:** Root README was misleading - described a massive multi-framework integration project when actual project is focused agent enhancement.

**For developers:** Root README referenced features that don't exist (Quint sync, DesignOS integration) and would confuse contributors.

**For users:** Root README promised capabilities (hypothesis tracking, design rationale) that aren't in current implementation.

**Impact:** 57% reduction in complexity (1,000 LOC vs. 2,300 LOC original estimate), completely different architectural approach.

## The Resolution

### Actions Taken

1. **✅ Archived old README:**
   - Moved `README.md` → `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ORIGINAL-VISION-README.md`
   - Preserved for historical reference
   - Clearly labeled as "archived vision"

2. **✅ Created new root README:**
   - Focus: Domain-specialized agents (Emma, Wade, Quinn, Stan)
   - Architecture: BMAD Agent Architecture Framework v1.1.0
   - Status: Emma operational, Wade in progress
   - Timeline: Week 1-3 implementation
   - Documentation: Links to user guides, test results, project status

3. **✅ Updated _bmad-output/README:**
   - Added link to new root README
   - Added reference to archived vision
   - Updated "Last Updated" to 2026-02-14
   - Marked old roadmap/BaseArtifact as SUPERSEDED/DEFERRED

---

## Key Differences: Old vs. New Vision

| Aspect | Original Vision (Archived) | Current Implementation |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **Goal** | Integrate 4 frameworks | Build 4 domain-specialized agents |
| **Complexity** | 2,300 LOC (estimated) | 1,000 LOC (57% reduction) |
| **Architecture** | Multi-framework orchestration | BMAD Agent Architecture Framework |
| **Timeline** | 24 weeks (6 months) | 3 weeks (decision gate) |
| **Deliverable** | BaseArtifact + Quint adapter | Emma, Wade, Quinn, Stan agents |
| **Status** | Planning phase | Emma operational, Wade in progress |
| **Risk** | High (complex integration) | Low (proven BMAD patterns) |
| **Value Delivery** | Week 10 (Quint ↔ BMAD) | Week 1 Day 2 (Emma operational) |

---

## Why the Pivot?

### Original Vision Challenges

1. **Complexity:** Multi-framework integration with SQLite sync is complex (2,700 LOC adapter alone)
2. **Risk:** Integration points between 4 frameworks create failure modes
3. **Time:** 24-week timeline delays value delivery
4. **Dependencies:** Requires understanding all 4 frameworks deeply

### Current Approach Benefits

1. **Simplicity:** Build on proven BMAD agent patterns (500 LOC per agent)
2. **Focus:** Domain expertise (UX research, design, quality, standards)
3. **Speed:** Emma operational Day 2, Wade Day 7
4. **Reusability:** Emma validates patterns for Wade/Quinn/Stan (33% faster development)
5. **Value:** Immediate delivery (empathy mapping operational now)

### Strategic Decision

**Insight:** Domain-specialized agents deliver more immediate value than framework orchestration.

**Validation:** Emma's 100% P0 test pass rate proves the approach works.

**Path Forward:** Build 4 agents (Week 1-3), evaluate success, decide on Phase 1 (Week 3 decision gate).

## What Happened to Original Vision Features?

### Feature: Quint Hypothesis Tracking

**Original Plan:** SQLite sync adapter to integrate Quint's FPF (2,700 LOC)

**Current Status:** DEFERRED to Phase 2 (post-Week 3 decision gate)

**Rationale:** Focus on agent delivery first, validate approach, then add Quint integration if needed

**Availability:** Quint still available standalone at `_quint/` (reference only)

---

### Feature: DesignOS Design Rationale

**Original Plan:** Integrate DesignOS decision records and Figma tokens

**Current Status:** SUPERSEDED by Emma (empathy-mapper)

**Rationale:** Emma provides design research capabilities (empathy mapping, user insights) without DesignOS dependency

**Availability:** Design rationale captured in Emma's empathy map artifacts

---

### Feature: AgentOS Quality Orchestration

**Original Plan:** Integrate AgentOS quality gates and multi-agent coordination

**Current Status:** SUPERSEDED by Quinn (quality-gatekeeper)

**Rationale:** Quinn provides quality gate capabilities using BMAD agent pattern

**Availability:** Quinn planned Week 2, Days 1-3

---

### Feature: BaseArtifact Contract

**Original Plan:** v2.0.0 contract for cross-framework traceability

**Current Status:** DEFERRED (may not be needed)

**Rationale:** BMAD markdown artifacts serve as contracts. May revisit in Phase 1 if Quint integration proceeds

**Availability:** Spec exists at [baseartifact-contract-spec.md](planning-artifacts/baseartifact-contract-spec.md)

---

## Migration Guide

### For Users Following Old README

**If you were expecting:**
- Quint hypothesis tracking → Use Quint standalone, or wait for Phase 2 integration
- DesignOS design rationale → Use Emma for empathy mapping and user insights
- AgentOS quality gates → Use Quinn (coming Week 2) for quality decisions
- Multi-framework traceability → Use BMAD markdown artifacts

**What you get instead:**
- ✅ Emma (empathy-mapper) - Operational now
- 🚧 Wade (wireframe-designer) - Week 1, Days 3-7
- 📋 Quinn (quality-gatekeeper) - Week 2, Days 1-3
- 📋 Stan (standards-auditor) - Week 2, Days 4-7

---

### For Developers Following Old Architecture

**If you were planning to work on:**
- SQLite sync adapter → Deferred to Phase 2
- BaseArtifact v2.0.0 → Deferred (may not be needed)
- Quint ↔ BMAD integration → Deferred to Phase 2
- DesignOS integration → Superseded by Emma/Wade

**What to work on instead:**
- Wade development (Week 1, Days 3-7) - Clone Emma structure
- Quinn development (Week 2, Days 1-3) - Quality gate workflows
- Stan development (Week 2, Days 4-7) - Standards audit workflows
- Integration testing (Week 3) - All 4 agents working together

**See:** [Phase 0 Implementation Guide](planning-artifacts/phase-0-implementation-guide.md)

## FAQ

### Will you ever implement the original multi-framework vision?

**Maybe, but not in the near term.**

The original vision (Quint + DesignOS + BMAD + AgentOS orchestration) was extensively analyzed and remains architecturally sound. However, we pivoted to domain-specialized agents for faster value delivery and lower risk.

**Possible future:**
- Phase 2 (if Week 3 decision gate succeeds): Add Quint SQLite sync adapter
- Phase 3+: Revisit DesignOS integration if user demand exists
- Community: Open to contributions that align with current architecture

### Is the old README wrong?

**No, it's not wrong - it's from an earlier planning phase.**

The old README describes a valid architectural approach that was thoroughly researched and documented. We chose a different path (domain-specialized agents) because:
- Faster delivery (3 weeks vs. 24 weeks)
- Lower risk (proven BMAD patterns vs. complex integration)
- Immediate value (Emma operational Day 2)

### Can I still read the old planning documents?

**Yes! They're all preserved in `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/`**

The architectural analysis, framework comparisons, and integration roadmap are valuable reference material even though we're not implementing that approach now.

**Useful documents:**
- [Architectural Decision Record](planning-artifacts/architectural-decision-record.md) - Why we chose BMAD-First
- [Technical Deep-Dive](planning-artifacts/technical-deep-dive-analysis.md) - 50K+ word analysis of all 4 frameworks
- [Framework Comparison](planning-artifacts/4-framework-comparison-matrix.md) - Capabilities matrix
- [Integration Roadmap](planning-artifacts/integration-roadmap.md) - 24-week plan (superseded)

### What if I prefer the multi-framework approach?

**You can fork the project and implement it!**

All the planning artifacts, architecture documents, and implementation guides exist. The multi-framework orchestration approach is technically sound - we just chose a different path for this project.

**Requirements:**
- 2,700 LOC SQLite sync adapter (Quint ↔ BMAD)
- BaseArtifact v2.0.0 contract implementation
- Cross-framework traceability system
- Integration testing across 4 frameworks

**Timeline:** ~24 weeks (original estimate)

## Lessons Learned

### What We Learned from This Conflict

1. **Documentation Drift is Real**
   - Root README became stale during planning phase
   - Need regular documentation reviews
   - **Solution:** Weekly doc updates, version tracking

2. **Planning vs. Implementation Mismatch**
   - Extensive planning created artifacts that assumed original vision
   - Pivot to agents meant docs were out of sync
   - **Solution:** Mark old docs as SUPERSEDED/ARCHIVED clearly

3. **Multiple Sources of Truth Create Confusion**
   - Two READMEs describing different projects
   - Users/developers didn't know which to trust
   - **Solution:** Single root README, clear hierarchy

4. **Pivots Need Communication**
   - Architectural pivot (multi-framework → agents) wasn't reflected in root docs
   - External stakeholders would be confused
   - **Solution:** This conflict resolution doc, updated README

### How We'll Prevent This

1. **Single Source of Truth:** Root README.md is canonical
2. **Clear Status Labels:** ARCHIVED, SUPERSEDED, DEFERRED, CURRENT
3. **Regular Reviews:** Update README with every major milestone
4. **Version Tracking:** "Last Updated" dates on all docs
5. **Linking:** Cross-reference related docs clearly
