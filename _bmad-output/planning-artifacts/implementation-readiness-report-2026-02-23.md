# Implementation Readiness Assessment Report

**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Project:** BMAD-Enhanced v1.6.0
**Assessor:** Implementation Readiness Workflow (Full Assessment)

---

## Document Inventory

### Documents Assessed
- **PRD:** `prd.md` (v1.6.0, 12 steps complete, 52 FRs, 26 NFRs, 7 journeys)
- **Architecture:** `architecture.md` (8 decisions D1-D8, contract architecture, build order)
- **Epics & Stories:** `epics.md` (5 epics, 24 stories, all 4 steps complete)

### Documents Not Assessed
- `greenfield-architecture-analysis.md` — Superseded by main architecture document
- **UX Design:** Not applicable — CLI/agent framework with no traditional UI

### No Duplicates Found

## PRD Analysis

### Requirements Summary

| Category | Count | Coverage Areas |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| Functional Requirements | 52 | 12 capability areas |
| Non-Functional Requirements | 26 | 6 quality categories |
| Handoff Contracts | 10 | HC1-HC10 enumerated with source→target |
| User Journeys | 7 | With FR traceability |
| Measurable Outcomes | 6 | With specific targets |

### PRD Observations

1. **FR49 inconsistency:** PRD states "every workflow directory has a template subdirectory" but Architecture D8 relaxes this. Epics correctly mark FR49 as relaxed. PRD should be updated to reflect the relaxation.
2. **Contract count discrepancy:** Early PRD text references "9 handoff contracts" but the contract inventory table lists 10 (HC1-HC10). The 10-contract count in the table is authoritative.
3. **FR47 scope:** "Referencing all declared handoff contracts for that agent" means each workflow's Compass references its specific contracts, not all 10. Stories correctly implement this scoping.

---

## Epic Coverage Validation

### Coverage Statistics

- **Total PRD FRs:** 52
- **FRs covered in epics:** 51
- **FRs relaxed by Architecture:** 1 (FR49, Decision D8)
- **Coverage:** 100% addressed (51 covered + 1 intentionally relaxed)
- **Missing FRs:** 0

### FR-to-Story Traceability (Verified)

Every FR was cross-checked against story acceptance criteria — not just the coverage map claims. All 51 active FRs have specific, testable ACs in their assigned stories.

### Adversarial Finding: HC6-HC10 Schema Coverage

FR25 says "each of the 10 handoff contracts has a defined artifact schema." Story 1.4 covers HC1-HC5 (artifact contracts) with full schemas. HC6-HC10 are routing contracts — documented as Compass table entries in Story 1.5, not artifact schemas. This is intentional per architecture (routing vs. artifact distinction). **No gap — architecture decision is sound.**

---

## UX Alignment Assessment

### UX Document Status: Not Found — Not Required

BMAD-Enhanced is a Developer Tool + Content Platform. Users interact through IDE conversation, not a traditional GUI. The "UX" is the workflow step architecture, agent personas, and artifact formats — all covered by FRs 46-52 and NFRs 15-20.

**No UX alignment issues.**

## Epic Quality Review

### Epic Structure Assessment

| Epic | User Value | Independence | Stories Sized | Dependencies Clean | FR Traceability |
|------|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1: Vortex Foundation | ✅ (borderline but acceptable for brownfield) | ✅ Standalone | ⚠️ Acceptable | ✅ No forward deps | ✅ Complete |
| 2: Mila | ✅ Clear user outcome | ✅ Needs only Epic 1 | ⚠️ Story 2.2 oversized | ✅ No forward deps | ✅ Complete |
| 3: Liam | ✅ Clear user outcome | ✅ Needs only Epic 1 | ⚠️ Story 3.2 oversized | ✅ No forward deps | ✅ Complete |
| 4: Noah | ✅ Clear user outcome | ✅ Needs only Epic 1 | ⚠️ Story 4.2 oversized | ✅ No forward deps | ✅ Complete |
| 5: Vortex Integration | ✅ Seamless navigation | ✅ Needs Epics 1-4 | ✅ Well-scoped | ✅ No forward deps | ✅ Complete |

### Issues Found

#### 🟠 Major Issue

**1. Primary workflow stories (2.2, 3.2, 4.2) are oversized**

Each primary workflow story carries 12-15 acceptance criteria and covers the bulk of the FR load for its epic. Story 2.2 alone covers 15 FRs. Implementation includes 4-6 step files with frontmatter, input validation, Compass routing with contract references, three-way routing distinction, A/P/C menu integration, and sourceArtifact traceability.

**Impact:** Estimation risk. These stories will take significantly longer than other stories in the same epic.

**Recommendation:** During sprint planning, decompose each X.2 story into subtasks (step-01-setup, step-02-context, core steps, Compass routing step). The story remains as-is — subtask decomposition happens at dev time.

#### 🟡 Minor Concerns

**2. FR49 not marked as relaxed in PRD**

The PRD states FR49 as active. Architecture D8 relaxed it. Epics correctly reflect the relaxation. PRD should be updated for consistency.

**3. Story 1.4/1.5 contract split could cause confusion**

Story 1.4 covers HC1-HC5 (artifact schemas). Story 1.5 covers HC6-HC10 (routing guidance). FR25 references "all 10 contracts." A developer reading FR25 and Story 1.4 might think HC6-HC10 are missing. The stories could be more explicit that the split is intentional.

**4. Epic 1 title reads technical**

"Vortex Foundation — Contracts, Routing & Infrastructure" is accurate but not user-centric. The goal statement compensates. Minor.

## Summary and Recommendations

### Overall Readiness Status

## READY

The project is ready for implementation. All three solutioning documents (PRD, Architecture, Epics & Stories) are complete, aligned, and traceable. No critical issues found.

### Issues Summary

| Severity | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| 🔴 Critical | 0 | — |
| 🟠 Major | 1 | Primary workflow story sizing |
| 🟡 Minor | 3 | PRD/FR49 sync, contract split clarity, epic title |

### Recommended Actions Before Implementation

1. **Decompose stories 2.2, 3.2, 4.2 into subtasks during sprint planning** — Each primary workflow story should be broken into 4-6 subtasks aligned to step files. This is a sprint planning activity, not an epics document change.

2. **Update PRD FR49 to mark as relaxed** — Add "(RELAXED — Architecture D8)" to FR49 in the PRD for document consistency. 2-minute fix.

3. **Validate HC1 and HC2 contract schemas early** — Per elicitation finding E2, HC2 (Mila→Liam) is the most critical cross-epic handoff. Validate these schemas during Epic 1 before parallelizing Epics 2-4.

### What's Strong

- **100% FR coverage** — 51/52 FRs have traceable story coverage. FR49 intentionally relaxed.
- **Clean dependency chain** — Epic 1 → Epics 2/3/4 (parallel) → Epic 5. No circular or forward dependencies.
- **Architecture alignment** — All 8 architecture decisions (D1-D8) are reflected in story acceptance criteria.
- **Quality gates embedded** — P18 (Epic 1 gate), P19 (handoff validation), RF3 (persona prerequisite) are all captured in epic metadata.
- **Brownfield-appropriate structure** — Migration, compatibility, and regression stories are properly placed.

### Final Note

This assessment identified **1 major** and **3 minor** issues across 2 categories. The major issue (story sizing) is a sprint planning concern, not a structural defect — the stories are correct, just large. All three documents are well-aligned and ready for Phase 4 implementation. Proceed with confidence.
