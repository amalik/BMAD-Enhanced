**For Testing:** T-WF-05 (Create Empathy Map), T-WF-09 (Validate Empathy Map)

## User Profile

**Name:** Sarah Chen
**Age:** 34
**Occupation:** Marketing Manager
**Tech Savviness:** Medium-High
**Primary Device:** iPhone 13

## Context

Sarah uses mobile banking apps daily for checking balances, transferring money, and paying bills. She values speed and security but gets frustrated by complex authentication flows.

## Research Evidence

**Interview Date:** 2026-02-10
**Interviewer:** UX Researcher
**Duration:** 45 minutes

### Key Quotes

"I just want to check my balance quickly - why do I need to enter a password AND a code from my phone?"

"The app is pretty, but sometimes I can't find basic features like 'transfer money' - it's buried in menus."

"I trust the app with my money, but I don't trust it won't log me out halfway through paying a bill."

### Observed Behaviors

- Opens app 3-5 times per day
- Most sessions < 2 minutes (quick checks)
- Abandons transactions if authentication takes > 30 seconds
- Prefers biometric login (Face ID) over passwords

### Pain Points

- Authentication friction (multiple steps)
- Feature discoverability (hidden in nested menus)
- Session timeouts during transactions
- Unclear error messages when transfers fail

### Desired Gains

- One-tap balance check (no login required)
- Quick access to frequent actions (transfer, pay bills)
- Confidence that transactions won't time out
- Clear explanations when something goes wrong
