# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Amalik
**Date:** 2026-02-05

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Phase 0 POC implementation for BMAD-Enhanced - orchestration capabilities across all 4 frameworks

**Goals:**
- Explore orchestration patterns for multi-framework coordination (BMAD Method, Quint FPF, DesignOS, AgentOS)
- Identify how DesignOS and AgentOS capabilities surface through the agent library
- Generate ideas for proving cross-framework orchestration works
- Focus on backend mechanics and agent coordination, not UI/UX polish
- Ensure all 22+ agents can leverage capabilities from all 4 frameworks

### Context Guidance

_Project context loaded from BMM module - focusing on software and product development with emphasis on:_
- Technical approaches and architecture patterns
- Integration challenges across framework boundaries
- Backend orchestration and coordination mechanisms
- Agent library design as unified interface layer

### Session Setup

**Scope Clarification:**
- All 4 frameworks in scope: BMAD Method (mature, markdown-based), Quint FPF (mature, SQLite-based), DesignOS (planned), AgentOS (planned)
- Agent library serves as the orchestration interface
- Phase 0 POC target: Week 3 deadline to prove feasibility
- Focus area: Backend orchestration mechanics, not user experience polish
