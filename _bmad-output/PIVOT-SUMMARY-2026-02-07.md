# Phase 0 Pivot Summary

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Decision:** Pivot from custom orchestration engine to agent enhancement approach
**Status:** ✅ EXECUTED - All planning documents updated

---

## What Changed?

### Before (ADR v1.3.0)
- **Approach:** Build custom orchestration engine
- **LOC Estimate:** 1,800 LOC
- **Goal:** Validate "Capabilities + Steps" pattern
- **Assumption:** DesignOS/AgentOS are markdown workflow systems

### After (ADR v1.4.0)
- **Approach:** Enhance BMAD with 4 new agents
- **LOC Estimate:** 500 LOC (72% reduction)
- **Goal:** Leverage proven BMAD agent architecture
- **Reality:** DesignOS is TypeScript web app, AgentOS is CLI tool

---

## Why Did We Pivot?

### Discovery: DesignOS/AgentOS Are NOT Markdown Systems

**Deep-dive analysis revealed:**
- **DesignOS:** TypeScript web application with browser UI (1.4k stars, MIT license)
- **AgentOS:** Shell-based CLI tool for standards management (3.7k stars, MIT license)
- **Neither uses markdown workflows like BMAD Method**

**Impact:** Cannot integrate by adding `_designos/` and `_agentos/` markdown directories as originally planned.

### BMAD Already Provides 80%+ of Their Functionality

**Existing BMAD Capabilities:**
- **Design:** CIS Design Thinking Coach (Maya) - Full 7-step design thinking workflow
- **Quality:** TEA Test Architect (Murat) - 9 quality workflows including quality gates
- **UX:** BMM UX Designer (Sally) - Wireframes and prototypes

**Gap:** Minimal - mostly packaging and specific UI patterns

### Agent Enhancement Is Lower Risk

**Benefits:**
- **72% less code:** 500 LOC vs 1,800 LOC
- **Proven infrastructure:** 21 agents already work in production
- **Immediate user value:** Working agents Week 1-2 (not just backend POC)
- **Realistic timeline:** 500 LOC in 3 weeks comfortable vs 1,800 LOC ambitious

---

## What Are We Building?

### 4 New BMAD Agents

**Week 1: DesignOS-Inspired Agents**
1. **Emma (empathy-mapper)** - User empathy mapping workflows
2. **Wade (wireframe-designer)** - Rapid wireframe generation

**Week 2: AgentOS-Inspired Agents**
3. **Quinn (quality-gatekeeper)** - Quality gate decision workflows
4. **Stan (standards-auditor)** - Code standards compliance checking

**Week 3: Integration**
- Cross-agent workflow orchestration
- Party mode integration
- Documentation & decision gate

## Key Metrics

### Code Reduction
- **Original Plan:** 1,800 LOC (Phase 0) + 500 LOC (Phase 2) = 2,300 LOC
- **New Plan:** 500 LOC (Phase 0) + 500 LOC (Phase 2) = 1,000 LOC
- **Reduction:** 1,300 LOC saved (57% reduction)

### Timeline
- **Phase 0:** 3 weeks (unchanged)
- **Implementation:** More realistic (500 LOC comfortable vs 1,800 LOC ambitious)

### Risk
- **Before:** Building custom orchestration engine (untested)
- **After:** Extending proven agent system (21 agents in production)
- **Risk Reduction:** Significant

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Now)

1. **Review Implementation Guide**
   - Read: [phase-0-implementation-guide.md](./planning-artifacts/phase-0-implementation-guide.md)
   - Understand 4 agent specifications
   - Review week-by-week breakdown

2. **Decide on Start Date**
   - When to begin Week 1 (Emma + Wade agents)?
   - Confirm 3-week timeline commitment

3. **Optional: Update Remaining Documents**

## Decision Gate (Week 3)

### Primary Question
Does agent enhancement approach prove viable for BMAD-Enhanced integration?

### Decision Options

**Option A: Proceed to Phase 1** (Contract Foundation)
- Agent approach proven viable
- Continue with BaseArtifact v2.0.0

**Option B: Enhance Agent Capabilities** (Phase 1.5)
- Agent approach viable but needs more coverage
- Add 4-8 more agents before Phase 1

**Option C: Pivot to Custom Orchestration** (Phase 0.5)
- Agent approach doesn't scale
- Build custom orchestration engine (original plan)

**Option D: Hybrid Approach**
- Agents for user-facing features
- Custom orchestration for backend

## Summary

**What Happened:** Deep-dive analysis revealed DesignOS/AgentOS are not markdown systems. Pivoted Phase 0 from custom orchestration (1,800 LOC) to agent enhancement (500 LOC).

**Why:** BMAD already provides 80%+ of functionality. Agent approach is 72% less code, proven infrastructure, lower risk.

**What's Next:** Implement 4 new agents (Emma, Wade, Quinn, Stan) over 3 weeks. Decision gate Week 3 to evaluate approach viability.

**Documents:** 4 updated, 1 comprehensive implementation guide created, all planning aligned.

**Ready to Start:** Read [phase-0-implementation-guide.md](./planning-artifacts/phase-0-implementation-guide.md) and begin Week 1 when ready.
