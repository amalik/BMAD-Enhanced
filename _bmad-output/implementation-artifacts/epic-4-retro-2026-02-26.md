## Successes

1. **Architectural consistency across 3 workflows** — Stories 4-2, 4-3, and 4-4 all followed identical structure (1 workflow.md + 5 step files), each with its own core differentiator (signal analysis, behavior classification taxonomy, P1/P2/P3 prioritization)
2. **Quality maintained at 0H/0M** — Continued the severity baseline established in Epic 3 across all 5 stories and 50 acceptance criteria
3. **Zero voice contamination** — Noah's calm, observational voice maintained across 21 files with no cross-agent bleed
4. **Full Vortex domain continuity** — HC5 example artifact traces the "Busy Parents Meal Planning" domain from HC2 (Mila) through HC3 (Liam) to HC5 (Noah), demonstrating a complete Vortex journey
5. **Noah's "intelligence, not strategy" boundary** — Clear and consistent across all workflows; users will never confuse Noah with Max
6. **100% follow-through on Epic 3 agreements** — All 5 team agreements honored

---

## Challenges

1. **Three consecutive content-only epics** — Process is battle-tested for markdown creation but untested against code-change stories
2. **Autopilot risk on repetitive workflow stories** — Stories 4-2, 4-3, 4-4 share identical skeleton; by Story 4-4 the risk shifted from errors to missing nuance
3. **Epic 5 introduces fundamentally different work** — Modifying existing agent workflows (Isla, Wade, Max) and writing CI code is a different type of work than creating new files from templates

---

## Key Insights

1. **Canonical template maturity is the quality multiplier** — The template eliminates errors more reliably than any review process
2. **Consistency that makes content epics clean may not transfer to integration work** — Epic 5 requires a mindset shift
3. **Existing agent workflows are untouched since creation** — Editing them carries regression risk that requires read-before-edit discipline
4. **Code review severity trending**: Epic 2 (2H/12M/12L) → Epic 3 (0H/0M/8L) → Epic 4 (0H/0M/15L, 3L/story same rate) — genuine quality improvement

## Previous Retrospective Follow-Through (Epic 3)

| Agreement | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Continue adversarial code review on every story | ✅ Completed | All 5 stories reviewed adversarially |
| Retire pre-dev quality review as standalone step | ✅ Completed | Canonical template absorbed this function |
| Continue filesystem verification in Dev Notes | ✅ Completed | Every story verified step file paths |
| Voice bleed check mandatory — zero tolerance | ✅ Completed | Zero contamination across 21 files |
| Code review severity baseline 0H/0M | ✅ Completed | 0H/0M maintained across all 5 stories |

**Follow-through: 5/5 (100%)**

## Action Items

### Process Improvements

1. **Read-before-edit mandate for existing files**
   - Owner: Dev Agent
   - Success criteria: Every story that modifies an existing file must document the current state in Dev Notes before making changes

2. **File-touch mapping during create-story**
   - Owner: SM Agent
   - Success criteria: Each Epic 5 story explicitly lists which existing files will be modified and flags overlap with other stories

### Team Agreements (6 total)

**Carried from Epic 3:**
- Continue adversarial code review on every story
- Continue filesystem verification in Dev Notes
- Voice bleed check remains mandatory — zero tolerance
- Code review severity baseline remains 0H/0M

**New for Epic 5:**
- Read-before-edit — no modifications to existing workflows without documenting current state first
- Eyes open for regression risk — verify existing behavior still works after edits

## Epic 5 Preparation

### Readiness Assessment

| Dimension | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Prerequisites | ✅ Ready — all 7 agents defined, all workflows created |
| Technical Blockers | ✅ None |
| Knowledge Gaps | Minor — existing synthesize step structure (addressed by read-before-edit) |
| Dependencies | ✅ Met — Epics 2, 3, 4 deliverables stable |
| Testing | ✅ Ready — 259 tests green, lint clean |

### Preparation Tasks (in-flight during Epic 5)

- [ ] Verify compass-routing-reference.md completeness (during Story 5-1)
- [ ] Map file-touch overlap between Stories 5-1 and 5-2 (during create-story)
- [ ] Confirm test suite exercises code paths (before Story 5-4)

### Key Shift

Epics 2-4 created new agents and workflows from templates. Epic 5 modifies existing agent workflows and adds CI validation. No formal prep sprint needed — just discipline and awareness.

**Verdict:** Epic 5 can start immediately. No prep sprint needed.

---

## Significant Discoveries

None. Nothing from Epic 4 fundamentally changes the plan for Epic 5. The direction is sound.

---

## Next Steps

1. Begin Epic 5 — no prep sprint needed
2. Execute with read-before-edit discipline on existing files
3. Review action items in next standup
4. Start creating stories with `create-story`
