| Stories completed | 5/5 (100%) |
| Story type | All content-only (markdown files, no JavaScript) |
| Total files created/modified | 17 (1 agent def, 3 workflow.md replaced, 13 step files new, 1 user guide, 1 example artifact) |
| Total tasks/subtasks | 27 tasks, 222 subtasks — all completed |
| Code review issues found | 8 total (0H, 0M, 8L) across 5 stories — all acceptable |

| Regressions | 0 |
| Lint | Clean across all stories (259 tests green) |
| New technical debt | 0 |

## Successes

1. **Canonical template pattern fully mature** — Story 3-2's hypothesis-engineering workflow followed the proven structure from Epic 2, and Stories 3-3 and 3-4 executed with near-zero friction. Three epics of consistent, predictable delivery.
2. **Quality step change** — 0H/0M/8L compared to Epic 2's 2H/12M/12L. Not a single HIGH or MEDIUM finding across 5 stories and 17 files.
3. **Voice consistency perfect** — Liam's energetic, challenging persona ("What's the bold version?", "stress-test", "falsifiable") maintained across all files with zero contamination from Isla, Mila, or Wade.
4. **Filesystem verification commitment delivered** — Epic 2's retro action item to add filesystem verification to Dev Notes eliminated stale-path errors entirely. Zero instances in Epic 3 (vs. the `handoff-contracts/` problem in Epic 2).
5. **HC3 example traces to HC2 example** — busy parents meal planning domain maintained across Mila→Liam, with specific evidence numbers (22/28, 6/8, 9/12) tracing back to the HC2 artifact. Demonstrates realistic Vortex flow.
6. **Complete Liam toolset** — 3 workflows (hypothesis-engineering 5 steps, assumption-mapping 4 steps, experiment-design 4 steps), user guide with 9 sections, and example HC3 artifact with 3 hypotheses, 8 assumptions, and recommended testing order.

## Challenges

1. **Story structure mismatch for lighter stories** — Story 3-5 (user guide + example artifact) produced 2 files vs the 5-file pattern of workflow stories. Not a problem, but the story template is optimized for heavier workflow stories.
2. **Pre-dev quality review inconsistently applied** — Not all stories received explicit pre-dev quality review. The canonical template absorbed much of this function, but the commitment from Epic 2 was only partially honored.
3. **Three consecutive content-only epics** — Process is untested against code-change stories. Epic 5 (integration) will be the real stress test for our patterns and review process.

---

## Key Insights

1. **Mature templates reduce errors more than any review process** — The canonical template (workflow.md + step files) is now the primary quality gate. Fewer opportunities for error means fewer errors.
2. **Simple process commitments eliminate entire error categories** — The filesystem verification reminder is a one-line addition to Dev Notes that eliminated all stale-path issues. Low cost, high impact.
3. **Code review severity trending down is genuine** — 0H/0M is not a softening bar; it reflects mature templates and applied learnings. Any future HIGH or MEDIUM finding is a genuine signal worth investigating.
4. **Content-only pattern proven across 3 epics** — but Epic 5 will be the real test when code changes return.

## Previous Retrospective Follow-Through (Epic 2)

| Action Item | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Continue adversarial code review on every story | ✅ Completed | All 5 stories received code review. 0H/0M/8L — quality improved over Epic 2 |
| Continue pre-dev quality reviews before dev-story | ⏳ Partial | Story 3-5 reviewed before dev-story; not consistently applied to all stories. Canonical template absorbed much of this function |
| Add filesystem verification reminder to Dev Notes | ✅ Applied | Zero stale-path issues in Epic 3 (vs. `handoff-contracts/` problem in Epic 2) |

**Follow-through rate:** 2/3 fully completed, 1/3 partial — overall good accountability.

## Team Agreements (Carry Forward to Epic 4)

1. **Continue adversarial code review** on every story — proven across 3 epics, non-negotiable
2. **Retire pre-dev quality review as standalone step** for content-only stories — canonical template has absorbed this function. Revisit for Epic 5 when code changes return.
3. **Continue filesystem verification in Dev Notes** — verify contract/schema paths against actual filesystem before referencing
4. **Voice bleed check remains mandatory** — zero tolerance for cross-agent contamination
5. **Code review severity baseline is 0H/0M** — any HIGH or MEDIUM finding is a genuine signal

## Technical Debt

No new technical debt introduced in Epic 3. Epic 1 carry-forward items remain unchanged:

| Item | Coverage | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| `bmad-update.js` | 29% | Low | CLI orchestration, low ROI |
| `bmad-version.js` | 56% | Low | CLI branches |
| `1.0.x-to-1.3.0.js` | 37% | Low | Legacy migration |

## Epic 4 Preparation Tasks

**Technical Setup (during Story 4-1):**
- [ ] Verify HC5 contract schema exists and review signal report format
- [ ] Review Noah's registry persona fields against agent-registry.js
- [ ] Verify Noah's Compass routes in compass-routing-reference.md (HC10 anomaly routing)

**Knowledge Development (during Story 4-1):**
- [ ] Understand Noah's "no recommendations" constraint — signals only for Max

**Domain Continuity Decision (before Story 4-5):**
- [ ] Decide whether HC5 example continues busy parents domain for full Vortex chain

**Critical Path Blockers:** None. All items can be absorbed into Story 4-1 setup.

## Epic 4 Readiness Assessment

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Prerequisites | Ready | HC5 schema, routing reference, registry — all from Epic 1 |
| Technical blockers | None | Same content-only pattern as Epics 2 and 3 |
| Knowledge gaps | Minor | HC5 format and HC10 routing — addressable during Story 4-1 |
| Dependencies | Met | Noah consumes Wade's HC4/HC5, not Liam's HC3 — no Epic 3 dependency |
| Testing | Ready | 259 tests green; no JS changes expected |
| Deployment | Local | npm publish deferred to v1.6.0 |

**Verdict:** Epic 4 can start immediately. No prep sprint needed.

---

## Next Steps

1. Begin Epic 4 — create Story 4-1 with `create-story`
2. Verify HC5, registry persona, and Compass routes during Story 4-1 setup
3. Apply adversarial code review after each story
4. Decide example domain continuity before Story 4-5
5. npm publish deferred to v1.6.0 release (all Wave 3 agents + integration complete)
