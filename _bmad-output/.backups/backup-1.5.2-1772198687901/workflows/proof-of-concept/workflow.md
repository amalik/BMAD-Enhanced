# Proof-of-Concept Workflow

Validate that you CAN build this before validating that you SHOULD.

## Steps Overview

1. **Define Technical Risk** - What could prevent this from working?
2. **Design PoC Scope** - Smallest test of technical feasibility
3. **Build Prototype** - Create proof-of-concept
4. **Test Technical Assumptions** - Does it work?
5. **Evaluate Feasibility** - Can we build this at scale?
6. **Document Findings** - What did we learn?
