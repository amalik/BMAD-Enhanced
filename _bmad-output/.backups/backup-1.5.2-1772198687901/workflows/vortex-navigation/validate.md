# Validate Vortex Navigation Recommendation

Bring me a navigation recommendation and I'll validate the reasoning, evidence basis, and plan quality.

## Validation Process

### 1. Evidence Basis Check

For the recommendation, ask:
- Is the current state assessment accurate and complete?
- Are all relevant artifacts accounted for?
- Is evidence quality rated honestly (not inflated)?

**Red Flags:**
- Streams marked "complete" with no artifacts
- High confidence with limited evidence
- Key streams not assessed at all

### 2. Gap Analysis Quality

- Are the identified gaps real risks or just "nice to know"?
- Is the critical gap truly the most critical?
- Are there obvious gaps that were missed?

### 3. Scoring Integrity

- Do the scores align with the evidence inventory?
- Is there comfort zone bias (familiar streams scored higher)?
- Are feasibility scores realistic?

### 4. Recommendation Logic

- Does the recommended stream address the most critical gap?
- Is the rationale clear and evidence-based?
- Does the alternative make sense as a backup?
- Is the "avoid" recommendation justified?

### 5. Plan Actionability

- Are next steps specific enough to execute?
- Are success criteria measurable?
- Are re-navigation triggers appropriate?

## Validation Criteria

**Strong Navigation:**
- Accurate state assessment with evidence
- Critical gaps clearly identified
- Scoring aligns with evidence
- Recommendation logically follows from analysis
- Plan is specific and actionable

**Needs Work:**
- Some gaps in state assessment
- Scoring doesn't fully align with evidence
- Plan needs more specificity

**Weak Navigation:**
- State assessment based on assumptions
- Critical gaps not identified
- Recommendation driven by preference, not evidence
- Plan is vague or unrealistic
