# Step 4: Stream Evaluation

With your current state, evidence, and gaps mapped, let's evaluate which streams are the best candidates for your next focus.

## Your Task

### Evaluation Criteria

Rate each candidate stream on these dimensions (1-5 scale):

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Gap severity** | How critical is the knowledge gap this stream would fill? |
| **Risk reduction** | How much would this stream reduce your biggest uncertainties? |
| **Dependency** | Does other work depend on completing this stream first? |
| **Feasibility** | Can you realistically execute this stream right now? (resources, skills, access) |
| **Time sensitivity** | Is there urgency? Will the opportunity to learn disappear? |

### Stream Scoring Matrix

| Stream | Gap Severity | Risk Reduction | Dependency | Feasibility | Time Sensitivity | **Total** |
|--------|-------------|----------------|------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Contextualize | {1-5} | {1-5} | {1-5} | {1-5} | {1-5} | {sum} |
| Empathize | {1-5} | {1-5} | {1-5} | {1-5} | {1-5} | {sum} |
| Synthesize | {1-5} | {1-5} | {1-5} | {1-5} | {1-5} | {sum} |
| Hypothesize | {1-5} | {1-5} | {1-5} | {1-5} | {1-5} | {sum} |
| Externalize | {1-5} | {1-5} | {1-5} | {1-5} | {1-5} | {sum} |
| Sensitize | {1-5} | {1-5} | {1-5} | {1-5} | {1-5} | {sum} |
| Systematize | {1-5} | {1-5} | {1-5} | {1-5} | {1-5} | {sum} |

### Anti-Patterns to Watch For

Before finalizing scores, check for these navigation anti-patterns:

- **Comfort zone bias** - Choosing familiar streams over ones where you have the biggest gaps
- **Analysis paralysis** - Cycling through Contextualize/Empathize without ever Externalizing
- **Premature optimization** - Jumping to Sensitize before validating core hypotheses
- **Skipping Empathize** - Building for imagined users instead of real ones
- **Ignoring Systematize** - Running experiments without capturing learnings

## Your Turn

Complete the scoring matrix. Be honest about feasibility -- a high-priority stream you can't execute is less useful than a medium-priority stream you can start tomorrow.
