# Step 3: Gap Analysis

Now let's identify what's missing. Gaps in your knowledge are the strongest signal for where to navigate next.

## Your Task

### Untested Assumptions

List your critical assumptions that remain untested:

| Assumption | Risk if Wrong | Stream to Test | Priority |
|------------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| {assumption} | {impact: high/medium/low} | {which stream} | {1-5} |

### Knowledge Gaps by Stream

**Contextualize gaps:**
- Do you know who your target user is? (Specific, not generic)
- Do you understand the problem space clearly?
- Is your product vision validated or assumed?

**Empathize gaps:**
- Have you talked to real users? How many?
- Do you understand their emotional experience?
- Are your personas based on research or imagination?

**Synthesize gaps:**
- Have you combined insights from multiple sources?
- Do patterns emerge from your research?
- Are there contradictions you haven't resolved?

**Hypothesize gaps:**
- Do you have testable hypotheses?
- Are they specific and falsifiable?
- Have you prioritized which to test first?

**Externalize gaps:**
- Have you tested your riskiest assumptions?
- Do experiment results support or challenge your direction?
- Is your evidence statistically meaningful?

**Sensitize gaps:**
- Have you measured user reaction to prototypes?
- Do you have feedback loops in place?
- Are you tracking the right metrics?

**Systematize gaps:**
- Have you captured learnings from experiments?
- Have you made explicit decisions based on evidence?
- Is there a clear decision trail?

### Critical Gap Identification

Which single gap, if filled, would most reduce your risk?

**Critical gap:** {description}
**Why critical:** {rationale}
**Stream to address it:** {stream name}

## Your Turn

Complete the gap analysis. Focus on gaps that represent real risk -- not just "nice to know" but "need to know before we can move forward."
