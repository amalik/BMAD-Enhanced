# Step 4: Pains & Gains Analysis

With your JTBD framed, we now map the specific pains users experience and gains they desire — grounded in artifact evidence.

## Why This Matters

Pains & Gains analysis reveals what users value versus what they tolerate. The data shows that understanding pains without gains leads to reactive solutions, while understanding gains without pains leads to solutions nobody needs urgently. You need both sides, cross-referenced against your JTBD from Step 3.

## Your Task

### 1. Map Pains

For each pain point your research reveals, capture these fields (aligned with the HC2 schema):

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Pain Description** | What the user struggles with | "Manually consolidating data from 6 tools every morning" |
| **Priority** | `High` / `Medium` / `Low` | High |
| **Frequency** | How often this pain is experienced | "Daily — every morning before standup" |
| **Intensity** | How severely it affects the user | "Blocks all other work for 2 hours" |
| **Evidence Sources** | Which artifacts support this pain | "Empathy map (artifact 1), Interview (artifact 2) — quote: '...'" |
| **Current Coping** | How users deal with this today | "Built a personal spreadsheet that takes 30 min to update" |

**Tips:**
- Prioritize by impact on the JTBD — which pains most prevent the user from getting the job done?
- Cross-reference against your Step 2 themes. These three pain points converge on a single root cause — look for that pattern.
- Include at least 3 pains with evidence from multiple artifacts

### 2. Map Gains

For each desired gain, capture:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Gain Description** | What outcome the user desires | "See all campaign metrics in real-time without manual work" |
| **Priority** | `High` / `Medium` / `Low` | High |
| **Expected Impact** | How achieving this changes things | "Saves 2 hours daily, enables real-time optimization" |
| **Evidence Sources** | Which artifacts support this gain | "Interview (artifact 2) — quote: 'If I could just see it all in one place...'" |

**Tips:**
- Gains should map to the expected outcome in your JTBD
- Look for gains that resolve multiple pains simultaneously — those are your highest-leverage opportunities
- Include at least 2 gains with artifact evidence

### 3. Cross-Reference Against JTBD

Now connect the dots:

- **Does each pain relate to the JTBD situation or motivation?** If a pain doesn't connect to the job, it may be real but out of scope.
- **Does each gain map to the JTBD expected outcome?** If a gain doesn't serve the outcome, it may be a nice-to-have rather than a core need.
- **Are there pains with no corresponding gain, or gains with no corresponding pain?** These gaps signal areas where the research may be incomplete.
