# Step 2: Context Loading & Analysis

Now that we know what artifacts we're working with, let's load them all and start identifying what the research is collectively telling us.

## Why This Matters

Individual research artifacts each tell part of the story. The data shows that the real insights emerge when you lay them side by side and look for where they agree, where they disagree, and where they're silent. Cross-artifact analysis is where convergence begins.

## Your Task

### 1. Load All Input Artifacts

Read through each of your input artifacts completely. Don't skim — the details matter for synthesis.

For each artifact, note:
- **Who** was researched (user segments, personas, interview subjects)
- **What** was discovered (key findings, insights, themes)
- **How strong** the evidence is (direct quotes, observed behavior, survey data, or assumptions)

### 2. Cross-Artifact Analysis

Now look across all your artifacts together. Here's what the research is telling us — or rather, here's how to listen:

**Themes:** What topics or concerns appear in multiple artifacts?
- Example: "Both the empathy map and interview synthesis mention time pressure as a recurring theme"

**Patterns:** What behaviors or needs show up repeatedly?
- Example: "Three separate artifacts reference users creating workarounds for the same limitation"

**Contradictions:** Where do artifacts disagree or present conflicting evidence?
- Example: "The empathy map suggests users want more features, but interviews reveal they feel overwhelmed by current complexity"

**Evidence Gaps:** What questions remain unanswered across all artifacts?
- Example: "We have strong evidence about pain points but almost no data on what users would consider a successful outcome"

### 3. Synthesis Inventory

Based on your cross-artifact analysis, build a mental model of what the artifacts collectively tell us. You don't need to write a formal document here — the HC2 problem definition comes in Step 5. Instead, organize your thinking:

- **Strongest signal:** What finding has the most evidence behind it?
- **Most surprising insight:** What did you not expect to find?
- **Biggest gap:** What do you wish you knew but don't?
- **Emerging problem shape:** If you had to describe the core problem in one sentence right now, what would it be?

## Example Cross-Artifact Analysis

**From 3 artifacts** (empathy map, interview synthesis, observation report):
- **Theme:** Time pressure appears in all 3 artifacts — users consistently mention feeling rushed
- **Pattern:** 2 of 3 artifacts show users building personal workarounds (spreadsheets, sticky notes) for the same data consolidation problem
- **Contradiction:** Empathy map suggests users want more features; interviews reveal they feel overwhelmed by current complexity
- **Gap:** Strong evidence on pain points, but almost no data on what "success" looks like to users
- **Emerging problem shape:** "Users spend more time gathering data than acting on it, and they've given up asking for help"

## Your Turn

Walk me through your cross-artifact analysis. What themes, patterns, contradictions, and gaps do you see? Three patterns converge on this insight — share what you're finding and I'll help you sharpen it.
