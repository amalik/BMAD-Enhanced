# Lean Experiment Workflow

Execute Build-Measure-Learn cycles to validate or invalidate hypotheses.

## Steps Overview

1. **State Hypothesis** - What do you believe is true?
2. **Design Experiment** - How will you test it?
3. **Define Metrics** - What will you measure?
4. **Run Experiment** - Execute and collect data
5. **Analyze Results** - What did you learn?
6. **Decide: Pivot or Persevere** - What's next?
