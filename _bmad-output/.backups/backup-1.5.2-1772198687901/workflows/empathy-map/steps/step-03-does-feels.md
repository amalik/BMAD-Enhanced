# Step 3: Does & Feels

Let's capture what your target user **does** (observable actions) and **feels** (emotional states).

## Why This Matters

Actions reveal priorities. Emotions drive decisions. Together, they show us:
- What users actually do vs. what they say they do
- Emotional triggers that influence behavior
- Moments of delight or frustration

## What vs. Why

- **DOES** - Observable behaviors, actions, and habits
- **FEELS** - Emotional states, reactions, and moods

## Your Task

### What They DO (3-5 observable actions)

What specific behaviors did you observe or did they describe? These are concrete, observable actions.

**Example:**
- Opens email client before any other app every morning
- Switches between 6 different tools to check campaign performance
- Takes screenshots of data to create manual reports in PowerPoint
- Sets reminders to follow up with leads but often misses them
- Batch-processes tasks on Friday afternoons to "clear the deck" for Monday

### What They FEEL (3-5 emotional states)

What emotions did they express or did you infer from their tone, body language, or word choice?

**Example:**
- Frustrated when tools don't integrate with each other
- Anxious about missing important lead notifications
- Proud when a campaign performs well
- Overwhelmed by the volume of data to analyze
- Relieved when repetitive tasks are automated

## Tips for Success

**For DOES:**
- Be specific (not "uses social media" but "checks LinkedIn 3x per day")
- Include frequency/timing when relevant
- Note workarounds or "hacks" they've created
- Look for patterns across multiple users

**For FEELS:**
- Use emotion words (frustrated, anxious, excited, relieved)
- Link emotions to specific moments or contexts
- Note intensity (mildly annoyed vs. deeply frustrated)
- Watch for contradictions (says "it's fine" but looks stressed)

## Connecting Does & Feels

Notice how actions and emotions influence each other:
- DOES: Switches between 6 tools → FEELS: Frustrated, overwhelmed
- FEELS: Anxious about missing notifications → DOES: Checks email obsessively

## Your Turn

Please provide:
1. 3-5 things your target user DOES (observable actions)
2. 3-5 things your target user FEELS (emotional states)
