# Step 2: Says & Thinks

Now let's capture what your target user **says out loud** and what they **think privately**.

## Why This Matters

There's often a gap between what people say and what they actually think. Understanding both helps us:
- Identify unspoken needs
- Spot contradictions that reveal pain points
- Understand social pressures influencing their behavior

## What vs. Why

- **SAYS** - Direct quotes from user research ("I check my email first thing every morning")
- **THINKS** - Inferred thoughts based on behavior and tone ("I'm worried I'll miss something important")

## Your Task

### What They SAY (3-5 direct quotes)

Pull actual quotes from your user research. These should be things they said out loud in interviews, surveys, or conversations.

**Example:**
- "I don't have time to learn a new tool right now"
- "My team needs better collaboration features"
- "I wish I could see all my campaigns in one place"

### What They THINK (3-5 inferred thoughts)

Based on their behavior, tone, and context, what are they thinking but not saying?

**Example:**
- "If I adopt this tool and it fails, I'll look bad to my boss"
- "I'm overwhelmed by the number of platforms I already use"
- "My current process is inefficient but at least it's familiar"

## Tips for Success

**For SAYS:**
- Use direct quotes (exact words when possible)
- Include both positive and negative statements
- Capture the language they use (jargon, metaphors, etc.)

**For THINKS:**
- Look for hesitation, tone shifts, or contradictions
- Consider what they DON'T say (conspicuous absences)
- Infer based on behavior, not speculation
