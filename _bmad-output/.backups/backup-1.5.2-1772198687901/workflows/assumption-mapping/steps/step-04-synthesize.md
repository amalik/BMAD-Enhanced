# Step 4: Synthesize & Route

You've extracted every assumption, classified each by lethality and uncertainty, and built a risk map with a testing order. Now let's validate the analysis is complete and figure out what happens next.

## Why This Matters

A risk map is only useful if it's honest. Before you act on it, we need to verify that every assumption was classified fairly, the testing order makes strategic sense, and the flagged concerns are genuine — not just the uncomfortable ones you want to avoid. If you can't prove it wrong, it's not a hypothesis — and if your risk map doesn't challenge you, it's not a risk map.

## Your Task

### 1. Review Your Assumption Risk Map

Verify the risk classifications from Step 3:

- [ ] Every assumption from the inventory has a lethality and uncertainty score
- [ ] No assumptions were conveniently classified as low-risk to avoid confronting them
- [ ] Cross-hypothesis assumptions (affecting multiple hypotheses) are flagged as higher priority
- [ ] Priorities are correctly derived from the lethality × uncertainty matrix

### 2. Review Your Testing Order

Verify the testing sequence makes strategic sense:

- [ ] Testing order prioritizes by lethality × uncertainty, not by convenience or cost
- [ ] Tiebreakers were applied correctly (most hypotheses affected → highest lethality → cheapest to validate)
- [ ] Each assumption has a suggested method and minimum evidence threshold
- [ ] The order would survive scrutiny from a skeptic — is this really the right sequence?

### 3. Review Flagged Concerns

If you flagged concerns for routing to Isla:

- [ ] Flagged concerns are genuinely unresolvable through experiments alone
- [ ] Each flag has a specific research question, not a vague "we need more info"
- [ ] The recommended action is actionable — Isla would know exactly what to investigate

### 4. Final Challenge

Before we route, stress-test the whole analysis:

**Completeness Check:**
- [ ] Did we surface unstated assumptions, not just the obvious ones?
- [ ] Did we challenge comfortable classifications?
- [ ] Would a different team arrive at the same risk map given the same hypotheses?

**Honesty Check:**
- [ ] Is the riskiest assumption truly the most lethal, or the most visible?
- [ ] Are the "Monitor" assumptions genuinely low-risk, or are we avoiding them?
- [ ] Does the testing order reflect strategic priority, not emotional comfort?

## Your Turn

Review the assumption risk map, testing order, and flagged concerns. Confirm when you're satisfied that the analysis is honest and complete.

## Vortex Compass

Based on what you just completed, here are your evidence-driven options:

| If you learned... | Consider next... | Agent | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| High-risk assumptions need validation before any experiment | user-discovery | Isla 🔍 | Unvalidated lethal assumptions need discovery research first |
| Assumptions are acceptable — riskiest are testable | lean-experiment | Wade 🧪 | Assumptions acceptable, proceed to test (HC3) |
| Hypotheses need refinement based on what the risk map revealed | hypothesis-engineering | Liam 💡 | Refine hypotheses based on risk map |

> **Note:** These are evidence-based recommendations. You can navigate to any Vortex agent
> at any time based on your judgment.

### ⚠️ Insufficient Evidence for Routing

If the evidence gathered so far doesn't clearly point to a single next step:

| To route to... | You need... |
|----------------|-------------|
| Isla 🔍 | Specific high-risk assumption identified with clear research question |
| Wade 🧪 | Risk map complete with acceptable risk profile and testing order |
| Liam 💡 | Clear signal that hypothesis contracts need structural revision |

**Workflow-specific signals:**
- All assumptions scored low-risk → may not need this workflow; proceed to Wade
- Cannot classify assumptions due to vague hypotheses → revisit **Liam's hypothesis-engineering** for sharper contracts
- Multiple lethal assumptions with no clear priority → consider routing to **Isla** for targeted discovery

**Recommended:** Revisit earlier steps to strengthen your risk map, or run **Max's [VN] Vortex Navigation** for a full gap analysis.
