# Step 2: Context Loading & Analysis

Now that we know what artifacts we're working with, let's load them all and build the pivot context. The data shows that the most important step in pivot resynthesis is understanding what the experiment actually revealed — and separating that from what the original research already told us.

## Why This Matters

You have two evidence streams: the original research and the experiment results. Laying them side by side reveals what still holds, what's been disproved, and what's newly understood. This is where we figure out what to revise and what to preserve.

## Your Task

### 1. Load All Input Artifacts

Read through each of your input artifacts completely. For each artifact, note:
- **What** was the original finding or hypothesis
- **How strong** the evidence was (direct quotes, observed behavior, survey data, or assumptions)
- **What happened** in the experiment related to this finding

### 2. Establish Pivot Context

Answer these four questions — they form the foundation for everything that follows:

**(a) What was the original problem definition?**
What JTBD, pains, and gains did the original HC2 define? If you don't have a prior HC2, summarize the original problem understanding from your HC1 artifacts.

**(b) What hypothesis was tested?**
What did the team believe would work? What riskiest assumption was the experiment designed to validate?

**(c) What did the experiment reveal?**
What failed and why? Was the hypothesis rejected outright, or partially confirmed? What unexpected results emerged?

**(d) What unexpected findings emerged?**
The data shows that failed experiments often reveal more than successful ones. What did you learn that nobody predicted?

### 3. "What Still Holds?" Assessment

This is the critical pivot analysis. For each element of your original problem definition, assess:

| Element | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| JTBD core (situation/motivation/outcome) | `Holds` / `Needs revision` / `Invalidated` | What evidence supports this assessment? |
| Pain 1: [name] | `Retained` / `Revised` / `Removed` / `New` | Experiment confirmed/contradicted this? |
| Pain 2: [name] | `Retained` / `Revised` / `Removed` / `New` | Experiment confirmed/contradicted this? |
| Gain 1: [name] | `Retained` / `Revised` / `Reprioritized` / `Removed` / `New` | What did the experiment show about this gain? |
| *Add rows as needed* | | |

**New elements to add:**
- Pains newly revealed by experiment failure
- Gains suggested by unexpected experiment findings
- Assumptions invalidated by experiment evidence

### 4. Synthesis Inventory

Based on your pivot context analysis, organize your thinking:

- **Strongest surviving signal:** Which original finding is most strongly confirmed by the experiment evidence?
- **Biggest revision needed:** What did the experiment most clearly disprove or change?
- **Most surprising insight:** What unexpected learning emerged from the failed experiment?
- **Revised problem shape:** If you had to describe the revised core problem in one sentence right now, what would it be?

## Example Pivot Context Analysis

**From original research (HC1)** + **experiment results (HC4):**

- **Original JTBD:** "When switching between tools during analysis, I want consolidated data views, so I can make decisions without context-switching."
- **Experiment tested:** A consolidated dashboard reducing tool-switching by 50%
- **What failed:** Users still switched tools despite the dashboard — the pain wasn't tool-switching, it was *not knowing which data to trust*
- **What holds:** JTBD core holds (users want to make decisions without friction). Situation needs revision: not "switching between tools" but "encountering conflicting data."
- **What changed:** Pain A (time spent switching tools) → Invalidated. New Pain: uncertainty about data accuracy. Gain priority shifted: "faster decisions" is less important than "confident decisions."

## Your Turn

Walk me through your pivot context analysis. The original research still holds — here's what we're revising based on what the experiment revealed. Three patterns converge on this insight — share what you're finding and I'll help you sharpen the revision.
