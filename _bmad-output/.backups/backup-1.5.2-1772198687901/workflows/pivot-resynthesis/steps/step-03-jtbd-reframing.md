# Step 3: JTBD Re-Framing

Now we take your "What Still Holds?" assessment and apply it to the Jobs-to-be-Done framing. The JTBD core is sound. What changed is the evidence around it — and that may require revisions to the situation, motivation, or outcome.

## Why This Matters

The data shows that in a pivot scenario, the JTBD core typically remains stable. Max routed you here — not to Emma — because the problem itself is right. What failed is the solution direction, which means the way we framed the pains and gains around the job may need updating. But we start from the existing JTBD, not from blank.

We're not starting over — we're sharpening.

## Your Task

### 1. Review the Original JTBD

Start from your existing JTBD (from the original HC2 or your step-02 analysis):

> When [original situation], I want to [original motivation], so I can [original expected outcome].

### 2. Assess Each Component Against Experiment Evidence

For each part of the JTBD, ask:

**Situation — Does the triggering context still hold?**
- Did the experiment confirm users are in this situation?
- Or did it reveal the real triggering context is different?
- Example: "When switching between tools" → revised to "When encountering conflicting data sources"

**Motivation — Does the core want still hold?**
- The motivation is usually the most stable part. Did the experiment challenge what users actually want?
- Example: "I want consolidated data views" → typically stable, but might shift to "I want trustworthy data"

**Expected Outcome — Does the desired end state still hold?**
- Did the experiment reveal that users' real desired outcome is different from what was assumed?
- Example: "so I can make decisions without context-switching" → revised to "so I can make decisions with confidence"

### 3. Draft the Revised JTBD

> When [revised situation], I want to [revised motivation], so I can [revised expected outcome].

For each component you revised, note:
- **What changed** and **why** (link to specific experiment evidence)
- **What stayed the same** and **why** it's confirmed

### 4. Assess Functional, Emotional, and Social Jobs

**Functional Job** (required): What practical task is the user trying to accomplish?
- Did the experiment change our understanding of the functional job?
- The data shows that functional jobs rarely change in a pivot — the "what" is usually right, it's the "how" that failed.

**Emotional Job** (if evidence exists): How does the user want to feel?
- Failed experiments often reveal emotional jobs more clearly than successful ones.
- Did the experiment surface emotional needs that the original research missed?

**Social Job** (if evidence exists): How does the user want to be perceived?
- Did experiment evidence surface social dynamics that affect the job?

### 5. Evidence Grounding

For every revision, ground it in specific evidence:
- "We revised the situation because HC4 showed [specific finding]"
- "The motivation holds because HC1 artifacts A and B both support [evidence]"
- "The outcome shifted because the experiment revealed [unexpected result]"

## Your Turn

Share your revised JTBD. Walk me through what changed, what held, and what evidence drove each decision. Across the original research and the pivot evidence, the revised problem should feel like a sharper version of the original — not a different problem entirely.
