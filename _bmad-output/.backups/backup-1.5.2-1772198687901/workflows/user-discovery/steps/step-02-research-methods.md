# Step 2: Choose Research Methods

Now that you know what you need to learn, let's choose the right methods to learn it. Different questions call for different approaches, and combining methods produces richer, more trustworthy findings.

## Why This Matters

Relying on a single research method creates blind spots. Interviews reveal what people say but not always what they do. Analytics show behavior but not motivation. Observation captures context but is hard to scale. The best discovery plans triangulate -- using multiple methods to validate findings from different angles.

## Method Menu

### Contextual Inquiry

**What it is:** Observing and interviewing users in their actual environment while they perform real tasks.

**Best for answering:**
- "What does their actual workflow look like?" (not the idealized version)
- "What environmental factors affect their experience?"
- "What workarounds and tools do they combine to get things done?"

**Practical guidance:**
- Visit users where they work (office, home, field)
- Ask them to perform their normal tasks while you observe
- Use the "master-apprentice" model: they are the expert, you are learning
- Capture the physical environment (desk setup, sticky notes, multiple monitors)
- Session length: 60-90 minutes per participant
- Recommended sample: 5-8 participants per segment

**Watch out for:** The Hawthorne effect -- people change behavior when observed. Schedule enough time that participants forget you're there.

### Diary Studies

**What it is:** Participants log their experiences over time (days or weeks) in a structured format you provide.

**Best for answering:**
- "How does this experience unfold over time?"
- "What triggers engagement or frustration?"
- "How frequently do specific problems actually occur?"

**Practical guidance:**
- Provide a simple logging template (time, activity, emotion, notes)
- Use tools participants already have (text messages, photos, simple forms)
- Keep the burden low: 2-3 entries per day, 5 minutes each
- Duration: 1-4 weeks depending on the cycle you're studying
- Send daily reminders and respond to entries to maintain engagement
- Recommended sample: 8-15 participants

**Watch out for:** Participant fatigue. Front-load the most critical days and keep the logging format minimal.

### Ethnographic Observation

**What it is:** Immersive observation of users in their natural context without direct interaction or task direction.

**Best for answering:**
- "What do users actually do versus what they report doing?"
- "What social and environmental dynamics influence behavior?"
- "What implicit norms or habits exist that users cannot articulate?"

**Practical guidance:**
- Observe without intervening or asking questions during the session
- Take detailed field notes: what you see, hear, and the environment
- Note timestamps so you can reconstruct sequences later
- Photograph or sketch the physical environment (with permission)
- Debrief with participants afterward to clarify what you observed
- Session length: 2-4 hours per observation
- Recommended sample: 4-6 sessions per context

**Watch out for:** Observer bias -- you will see what you expect to see. Bring a second observer when possible and compare notes independently before discussing.

### Surveys

**What it is:** Structured questionnaires distributed to a larger sample for quantitative and qualitative data.

**Best for answering:**
- "How prevalent is this behavior or attitude across our user base?"
- "What are the relative priorities among known needs?"
- "How do different segments compare on key dimensions?"

**Practical guidance:**
- Use surveys to validate and quantify patterns found in qualitative research, not to discover new patterns
- Keep surveys under 15 questions and under 5 minutes completion time
- Mix closed-ended (scales, multiple choice) with 1-2 open-ended questions
- Pilot test with 3-5 people before full distribution
- Target a minimum of 30 responses per segment for meaningful patterns
- Recommended sample: 50-200+ depending on segment count

**Watch out for:** Leading questions, double-barreled questions, and social desirability bias. Have someone outside the team review the survey before distribution.

### Analytics Review

**What it is:** Analyzing existing behavioral data from your product, website, or other systems.

**Best for answering:**
- "What do users actually do in our product?"
- "Where do they drop off, get stuck, or abandon?"
- "Which features are used most and least?"
- "How do behavioral patterns differ across segments?"

**Practical guidance:**
- Start with the user journey and map data to each stage
- Look for anomalies: unexpected drop-offs, surprising usage patterns, features with high engagement but low satisfaction
- Combine quantitative metrics with qualitative context (why is this number what it is?)
- Create cohort analyses to compare segments
- Time investment: 4-8 hours for a thorough review

**Watch out for:** Analytics show what happened but not why. Never draw motivational conclusions from behavioral data alone.

## Choosing Your Methods

### Method Selection Matrix

| Research Question | Contextual Inquiry | Diary Study | Observation | Survey | Analytics |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Understand workflows | Strong | Medium | Strong | Weak | Medium |
| Discover motivations | Strong | Strong | Weak | Medium | Weak |
| Measure prevalence | Weak | Weak | Weak | Strong | Strong |
| Track over time | Weak | Strong | Weak | Medium | Strong |
| Uncover environment | Strong | Medium | Strong | Weak | Weak |
| Validate patterns | Medium | Medium | Medium | Strong | Strong |

### Recommended Combinations

**Deep understanding of a new domain:** Contextual Inquiry + Diary Studies
**Validating known problems at scale:** Analytics Review + Survey
**Comprehensive discovery:** Contextual Inquiry + Analytics Review + Survey (confirmation)
**Longitudinal insight:** Diary Study + Analytics Review

## Your Task

For each of your research questions from Step 1:
1. Select 1-2 methods that best answer that question
2. Explain why you chose those methods
3. Note any constraints (budget, time, access to users) that limit your options

Aim for at least 2 different methods total across all questions to enable triangulation.
