# Step 3: Plan Research Activities

You know what to learn and which methods to use. Now let's build a concrete plan: who participates, when things happen, what materials you need, and how you handle ethics.

## Why This Matters

Research without a plan produces scattered, unreliable data. A clear plan ensures you recruit the right participants, prepare the right materials, and respect the people who give you their time and trust. It also gives stakeholders confidence that the investment will pay off.

## Your Task

### 1. Participant Recruitment

**How many participants do you need?**

Use these guidelines based on your chosen methods:
- Contextual inquiry: 5-8 per segment
- Diary studies: 8-15 total (expect 20-30% dropout)
- Ethnographic observation: 4-6 sessions
- Surveys: 50+ per segment (30 minimum for any pattern)
- Analytics review: N/A (uses existing data)

**Where will you find participants?**

| Source | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Existing users | Easy access, real context | Survivorship bias |
| Former users | Understand churn | Harder to reach, may be negative |
| Non-users | Fresh perspective | May not understand domain |
| Recruiting panels | Fast, screened | May not match real users |
| Community forums | Self-selected, passionate | Skewed toward vocal minority |
| Partner referrals | Trusted introduction | Small sample, filtered |

**Screening criteria:**
- What characteristics MUST participants have? (Include criteria)
- What characteristics DISQUALIFY someone? (Exclude criteria)
- How will you ensure diversity within your target population?

**Example screening questions:**
- "How often do you [relevant activity]?" (filters for frequency)
- "What tools do you currently use for [task]?" (filters for context)
- "How would you describe your experience level with [domain]?" (filters for expertise)

### 2. Timeline

Build a realistic timeline that accounts for the reality that recruitment always takes longer than expected.

**Template timeline:**

| Week | Activity | Deliverable |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Finalize plan, create materials, begin recruitment | Screener, guides, consent forms |
| 2 | Recruitment and pilot sessions (1-2) | Refined guides based on pilot |
| 3-4 | Core research sessions | Raw notes, recordings, artifacts |
| 5 | Data organization and initial synthesis | Organized data set, initial themes |
| 6 | Final synthesis and report | Discovery report artifact |

Adjust based on your methods. Diary studies extend the core research phase. Analytics reviews can compress the timeline significantly.

### 3. Research Materials

**For each method, prepare:**

**Contextual Inquiry:**
- Discussion guide (topics, not rigid questions)
- Observation checklist (what to look for in the environment)
- Note-taking template (timestamp, observation, interpretation columns)
- Recording equipment and backup plan

**Diary Studies:**
- Participant briefing document (what to log, how often, for how long)
- Logging template or tool setup
- Reminder schedule
- Incentive structure (when and how participants are compensated)

**Ethnographic Observation:**
- Observation protocol (where to position, what to record)
- Field notes template
- Camera/sketch supplies for environment capture
- Post-observation debrief questions

**Surveys:**
- Draft questionnaire with all questions
- Pilot test plan (3-5 people review before launch)
- Distribution channel and timeline
- Response target and follow-up plan

**Analytics Review:**
- Data sources and access confirmed
- Key metrics and events to analyze
- Cohort definitions
- Analysis framework (what comparisons to make)

### 4. Ethical Considerations

Research involves real people. Handle their trust with care.

**Informed Consent:**
- Explain the purpose of the research in plain language
- Describe what participation involves (time, activities, recording)
- State that participation is voluntary and can be stopped at any time
- Explain how data will be stored, used, and eventually deleted
- Get written consent before any session begins

**Privacy and Data Protection:**
- Anonymize data as early as possible (use participant codes, not names)
- Store recordings and notes securely (encrypted, access-limited)
- Define a data retention period and stick to it
- Never share raw data outside the research team without consent
- Be especially careful with screenshots, photos, and screen recordings

**Compensation:**
- Compensate participants fairly for their time
- Pay regardless of whether they complete the full session
- Common rates: $50-150/hour for professionals, gift cards for consumers
- For diary studies: milestone payments to maintain engagement

**Vulnerability:**
- Be aware that research can surface sensitive topics
- Have a plan for if a participant becomes distressed
- Never pressure someone to continue if they seem uncomfortable
- Researchers are not therapists -- know your boundaries

### 5. Logistics Checklist

- [ ] Recruitment screener created and distributed
- [ ] Consent forms prepared
- [ ] Discussion guides / observation protocols drafted
- [ ] Recording equipment tested
- [ ] Note-taking templates ready
- [ ] Incentives budgeted and procured
- [ ] Calendar invites sent with clear instructions
- [ ] Backup plan for no-shows (over-recruit by 20%)
- [ ] Data storage location set up and access confirmed
- [ ] Pilot session scheduled (at least 1 before core research)

## Your Turn

Please provide:
1. Your recruitment plan (how many, from where, screening criteria)
2. Your timeline (adapt the template above to your reality)
3. Which materials you need to prepare for your chosen methods
4. Your approach to consent, privacy, and compensation
5. Any logistical concerns or constraints

I'll review your plan for feasibility and completeness.
