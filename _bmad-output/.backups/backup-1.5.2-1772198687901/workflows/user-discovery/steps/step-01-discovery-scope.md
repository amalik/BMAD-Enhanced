# Step 1: Define Discovery Scope

Before any research begins, you need to be explicit about what you are trying to learn and why it matters. A well-scoped discovery prevents the two most common research failures: learning everything about nothing, and learning nothing about everything.

## Why This Matters

Discovery research is expensive in time, attention, and participant goodwill. A clear scope ensures every research activity produces knowledge that moves your product forward. Without it, teams collect volumes of data and still cannot answer the questions that matter.

## Your Task

### 1. State the Discovery Goal

What decision or direction will this research inform? Be specific about the business or product context that makes this discovery necessary right now.

**Strong examples:**
- "We're entering the small-business accounting market and need to understand how owners currently manage their finances before we design our onboarding flow."
- "Churn increased 15% last quarter among enterprise accounts. We need to discover what changed in their workflows or expectations."
- "We have three feature directions for Q3. We need to understand which user problems are most urgent to decide where to invest."

**Weak examples:**
- "We want to understand our users better." (Too vague -- what would change if you did?)
- "We need to do some research." (Not a goal, it's an activity.)

### 2. Formulate Research Questions (3-7)

Research questions are NOT interview questions. They are the knowledge gaps you need to close. Good research questions share three traits: they are specific, answerable through observation or conversation, and relevant to a decision you face.

**Example research questions:**
- "What does a typical day look like for a small-business owner managing finances? What tools, workarounds, and people are involved?"
- "At what point in the workflow do enterprise users become frustrated enough to consider alternatives?"
- "What criteria do users actually use when choosing between competing tools, versus what they say they use?"
- "How do environmental factors (noise, interruptions, device switching) affect how users interact with our product?"

**Tip:** If a question can be answered with a simple yes/no, it is not a research question -- it is a hypothesis. Save those for experiments (Wade can help with that).

### 3. Define the User Population

Who do you need to learn about? Be specific enough to recruit effectively, but broad enough that you do not accidentally study only your happiest customers.

**Consider:**
- Current users vs. non-users vs. former users
- Power users vs. casual users vs. struggling users
- Different roles, contexts, or segments
- People who might use your product but currently solve the problem differently

### 4. Set Success Criteria for Discovery

How will you know when discovery is "done enough"? Perfect knowledge is impossible, but you should define a threshold.

**Examples:**
- "We can confidently describe 3 distinct user segments and their primary workflows."
- "We have evidence-backed answers to all 5 research questions from at least 3 independent sources each."
- "We've identified the top 3 unmet needs and can rank them by severity with supporting evidence."

## Your Turn

Please provide:
1. Your discovery goal (what decision will this research inform?)
2. 3-7 research questions you need to answer
3. The user population you plan to study
4. Your success criteria for completing discovery

I'll review your scope for clarity, specificity, and feasibility before we proceed.
