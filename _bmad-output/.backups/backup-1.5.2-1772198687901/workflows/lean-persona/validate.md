# Validate Lean Persona

**Status:** Coming in v1.2.0

**Agent:** Emma (Contextualization Expert)

**Stream:** Contextualize

## Overview

This validation workflow helps you review lean personas against Lean Startup principles and ensure they're hypothesis-driven rather than assumption-based.

## What Gets Validated

- Is the job-to-be-done clearly defined?
- Are current pain points specific and measurable?
- Are desired outcomes testable?
- Are assumptions explicitly stated?
- Is there a clear validation plan?
- Does this avoid demographic stereotypes?

## Coming in v1.2.0

This validation workflow will be available alongside the lean-persona workflow in March 2026.
