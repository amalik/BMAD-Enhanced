# Step 3: Plan Participant Recruitment

The most perfectly designed interview script is worthless if you talk to the wrong people. This step ensures you recruit participants who can actually give you the insights you need.

## Why This Matters

Recruitment is the most underestimated part of user research. Common mistakes:
- Talking only to enthusiastic early adopters (survivorship bias)
- Recruiting friends and colleagues who tell you what you want to hear
- Getting participants who don't match your target user at all
- Not recruiting enough people to see patterns
- Spending weeks recruiting when you could start in days

## Your Task

Define your recruitment plan:

### 1. Define Your Screening Criteria

Who should you talk to? Be specific about must-have criteria and nice-to-have criteria.

**Must-have criteria** (participant is disqualified without these):
- What behavior or experience must they have?
- What timeframe matters? (e.g., "used the product in the last 30 days")
- What role, responsibility, or context must they be in?

**Nice-to-have criteria** (for diversity, not disqualification):
- Range of company sizes
- Mix of experience levels
- Different geographic regions
- Different tools or workflows

**Exclusion criteria** (who should you NOT talk to):
- Competitors or people in your industry who would be biased
- People with a financial relationship to your company
- Friends, family, or close colleagues

### 2. Determine Sample Size and Composition

**How many participants do you need?**

| Research Goal | Recommended Sample |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Exploratory discovery | 5-8 participants |
| Hypothesis validation | 8-12 participants |
| Comparative (two segments) | 5-6 per segment |
| Usability testing | 3-5 participants |

**Aim for diversity within your criteria.** If all 8 participants have the same background, you'll get one perspective eight times instead of eight perspectives once.

### 3. Choose Recruitment Channels

Where will you find these people?

| Channel | Best For | Lead Time | Cost |
|---------|----------|-----------|------|
| Existing user base (email/in-app) | Current user research | 3-5 days | Free |
| Social media / communities | Broad discovery research | 5-10 days | Free |
| Professional networks (LinkedIn) | B2B research | 5-7 days | Free |
| Recruitment panels (UserTesting, Respondent) | Fast turnaround, specific criteria | 1-3 days | $50-150/participant |
| Customer support tickets | Users with specific problems | 2-4 days | Free |
| Referral from other participants | Hard-to-reach segments | Ongoing | Free |

### 4. Write Your Screening Survey

Create 3-5 screening questions to qualify participants before scheduling.

**Example screening survey:**
> 1. What is your role? [Open text]
> 2. How many people are on your team? [1-5 / 6-20 / 21-50 / 50+]
> 3. Which project management tools do you currently use? [Checklist]
> 4. When did you last evaluate a new project management tool? [Last month / Last 3 months / Last 6 months / More than 6 months ago / Never]
> 5. Would you be available for a 30-45 minute video call in the next 2 weeks? [Yes / No]

**Screening logic:** Disqualify anyone who answers [specific disqualifying answers]. Prioritize anyone who answers [ideal answers].

### 5. Plan Incentives

Incentives increase response rates and show respect for participants' time.

| Participant Type | Suggested Incentive |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| General consumers | $25-50 gift card |
| Professionals (B2B) | $75-150 gift card |
| Senior executives / hard-to-reach | $150-300 gift card |
| Existing happy customers | Sometimes free; product credit works |
| Internal stakeholders | No incentive needed |

**Alternatives to cash incentives:**
- Donation to a charity of their choice
- Early access to a new feature
- Free subscription extension
- Co-creation credit (name in release notes)

### 6. Create Your Recruitment Timeline

**Example timeline:**
- Day 1-2: Post screening survey, send outreach messages
- Day 3-5: Review responses, qualify participants, schedule interviews
- Day 5-10: Conduct interviews (2-3 per day maximum to avoid fatigue)
- Day 10-12: Follow-up interviews if needed

**Important:** Never schedule more than 3 interviews in a single day. Interview fatigue degrades your listening quality after the third session.

## Example

**Screening Criteria:**
- MUST: Small business owner (1-10 employees)
- MUST: Currently uses spreadsheets for project tracking
- MUST: Evaluated at least one PM tool in the last 6 months but did not adopt it
- NICE-TO-HAVE: Mix of industries (not all tech)
- NICE-TO-HAVE: Mix of team sizes within 1-10 range
- EXCLUDE: Anyone who works for a PM tool company

**Sample:** 8 participants

**Channels:**
- Primary: LinkedIn outreach to small business owner groups (free)
- Secondary: Respondent.io panel with screening criteria ($100/participant)
- Backup: Referrals from first 3 participants

**Incentive:** $75 Amazon gift card

**Timeline:** 10 days total (3 days recruiting, 7 days interviewing)

## Your Turn

Please define your recruitment plan using the structure above.

**Tip:** Start recruiting immediately after finalizing your plan. Recruitment always takes longer than you think. Send your screening survey today, not tomorrow.
