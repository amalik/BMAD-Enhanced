# Step 4: Conduct Interviews

This step provides guidance for conducting interviews effectively. The actual interviews happen outside this workflow -- with real people, in real conversations. This is your reference guide for before, during, and after each session.

## Why This Matters

Even with a perfect script and perfect participants, poor interview technique will produce poor data. The difference between a novice interviewer and a skilled one is not the questions they ask -- it's how they listen, when they probe, and what they notice beyond the words.

## Before Each Interview

### Setup Checklist

- [ ] Review the participant's screening survey answers
- [ ] Have your interview script printed or visible (but not as a rigid checklist)
- [ ] Test your recording setup (if recording)
- [ ] Prepare a note-taking template (participant ID, date, key sections)
- [ ] Close distracting tabs and notifications
- [ ] Have water nearby (you'll be talking for 30-45 minutes)
- [ ] Arrive 2-3 minutes early to the call/meeting

### Mental Preparation

Remind yourself of three things:
1. **You are here to learn, not to validate.** If the participant contradicts your assumptions, that is the most valuable data.
2. **Silence is your friend.** When you stop talking, people fill the silence with their real thoughts.
3. **You are not selling.** Do not pitch, explain, or defend your product. Just listen.

## During the Interview

### The TEDW Framework for Active Listening

Use these four techniques throughout the interview:

**T - Tell me more**
When a participant says something interesting, don't jump to the next question. Say: "Tell me more about that." This simple phrase produces more insight than any cleverly designed question.

**E - Echo**
Repeat the participant's last few words as a question. Participant: "It was really frustrating when the report didn't export correctly." You: "Didn't export correctly?" This encourages them to elaborate without leading.

**D - Dig into specifics**
When answers are vague, ask for concrete details:
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "When was the last time that happened?"
- "Walk me through exactly what you did."
- "How many times did that happen last month?"

**W - Why (but carefully)**
"Why" questions can feel interrogative. Soften them:
- Instead of "Why did you do that?" try "What was going through your mind when you decided to...?"
- Instead of "Why don't you use X?" try "What has kept you from trying X?"
- "Help me understand your thinking there" works well as an alternative

### Managing Common Interview Situations

**The participant gives one-word answers:**
- Switch to storytelling prompts: "Walk me through a specific time when..."
- Share that you're genuinely curious (not testing them)
- Try "What else?" or "And then what happened?"

**The participant goes off-topic:**
- Let them finish their thought (sometimes tangents reveal gold)
- Gently redirect: "That's really interesting. Going back to [topic], I'd love to hear..."
- Note the tangent -- it might reveal an unmet need you hadn't considered

**The participant asks what YOU think:**
- Deflect: "I'm really curious about your perspective first."
- If pressed: "I have some ideas, but I don't want to bias your answers. Can I share after we finish?"

**The participant gets emotional:**
- Acknowledge: "It sounds like that was really frustrating."
- Pause. Give them space.
- Ask: "Would you like to continue, or should we skip to a different topic?"
- Never minimize: Do NOT say "It's not that bad" or "That's normal"

**The participant wants to design the solution for you:**
- Listen to the underlying need, not the proposed solution
- "That's an interesting idea. What problem would that solve for you?"
- "If that existed, what would be different about your day?"

**You realize your question was poorly worded:**
- It's fine to rephrase mid-interview: "Let me ask that differently..."
- Note it for script revision before the next interview

### Note-Taking During the Interview

**What to capture in real-time:**
- Direct quotes (mark with quotation marks)
- Emotional moments (mark with [EMOTION: frustration/excitement/surprise])
- Contradictions between what they say and what they do (mark with [CONTRADICTION])
- Specific numbers, frequencies, or timeframes they mention
- Names of tools, processes, or people they reference

**What NOT to do while taking notes:**
- Don't try to write everything down -- you'll stop listening
- Don't interpret while writing -- capture raw data now, analyze later
- Don't type loudly if on a video call -- it signals you're not fully present

**If recording:** Use the recording as backup, not as a replacement for notes. You will not re-listen to 8 hours of recordings. Your in-the-moment notes are more valuable.

## After Each Interview

### Immediate Debrief (within 15 minutes)

Complete this within 15 minutes of ending the interview, while everything is fresh:

1. **Top 3 things that surprised me:**
   - {surprise 1}
   - {surprise 2}
   - {surprise 3}

2. **Strongest quotes:**
   - "{quote 1}" -- Context: {when they said it}
   - "{quote 2}" -- Context: {when they said it}

3. **Key behaviors observed:**
   - {behavior 1} -- Frequency: {how often}
   - {behavior 2} -- Frequency: {how often}

4. **Assumptions confirmed or challenged:**
   - CONFIRMED: {assumption} -- Evidence: {what they said/did}
   - CHALLENGED: {assumption} -- Evidence: {what they said/did}

5. **What would I ask differently next time?**
   - {adjustment for next interview}

### Script Refinement

After each interview, ask yourself:
- Did any question consistently produce shallow answers? Rewrite it.
- Did a follow-up probe reveal something the main question missed? Promote it.
- Did the participant bring up a topic I hadn't considered? Add a question about it.
- Was the interview too long or too short? Adjust.

**Important:** It is normal and expected to refine your script between interviews. The first interview is always the roughest. By interview 3-4, your script should be significantly sharper.

## Your Turn

Review this guidance and confirm you're ready to begin interviewing. If you have specific concerns about interview technique or situations you expect to encounter, let's discuss them now.

**Tip:** Your first interview will feel awkward. That's normal. The goal is not perfection -- it's genuine curiosity. If you authentically care about understanding the participant's world, the technique will follow.
