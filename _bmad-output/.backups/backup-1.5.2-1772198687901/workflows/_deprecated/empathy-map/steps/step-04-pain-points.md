# Step 4: Pain Points

Now let's identify the **obstacles, frustrations, and challenges** your target user faces.

## Why This Matters

Pain points reveal opportunities. Every pain point is a potential solution waiting to happen. Understanding pain points helps us:
- Prioritize features that solve real problems
- Avoid building solutions for non-problems
- Empathize with user struggles

## Types of Pain Points

**Process Pain Points** - Inefficient workflows, too many steps, repetitive tasks

**Support Pain Points** - Lack of help, unclear documentation, slow response times

**Integration Pain Points** - Tools don't talk to each other, data silos, manual data transfer

**Learning Pain Points** - Steep learning curve, unclear UI, inconsistent patterns

**Emotional Pain Points** - Stress, anxiety, fear of failure, overwhelm

## Your Task

### Identify 4-6 Pain Points

For each pain point, capture:
1. **The Pain** - What's the problem?
2. **The Impact** - How does it affect them?
3. **The Evidence** - What research supports this?

**Example:**

**Pain #1: Data Scattered Across 6 Tools**
- **Impact:** Wastes 2 hours per day switching tools and manually consolidating data
- **Evidence:** "I feel like I spend more time gathering data than analyzing it" (INT-002)

**Pain #2: Can't See Campaign Performance in Real-Time**
- **Impact:** Misses opportunities to optimize underperforming campaigns early
- **Evidence:** Observed user checking analytics 8 times in a 30-minute session (OBS-001)

**Pain #3: No Automated Lead Scoring**
- **Impact:** Sales team complains about low-quality leads, creating tension between marketing and sales
- **Evidence:** "Sales always says our leads are junk, but we don't have a good way to prioritize them" (INT-003)

## Tips for Success

**Be Specific:**
- Not "Bad UX" but "Button to create campaign is hidden in nested menu"
- Not "Slow" but "Report generation takes 45 seconds, blocking other work"

**Quantify When Possible:**
- Time wasted
- Frequency of occurrence
- Number of steps involved

**Ground in Evidence:**
- Direct quotes
- Observed behavior
- Usage analytics

**Prioritize by Severity:**
- Which pain points cause the most frustration?
- Which ones waste the most time?
- Which ones risk critical failures?

## Your Turn

Please identify 4-6 pain points your target user faces. For each pain point, include:
1. The pain itself
2. The impact on the user
3. Evidence from research
