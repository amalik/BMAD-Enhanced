| If you learned... | Consider next... | Agent | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Experiment complete | learning-card | Max 🧭 | Capture validated learning before it fades |
| Experiment graduated | signal-interpretation | Noah 📡 | Monitor production signals (HC4) |
| User behavior surprising | empathy-map | Isla 🔍 | Understand why users behaved unexpectedly |

> **Note:** These are evidence-based recommendations. You can navigate to any Vortex agent
> at any time based on your judgment.
