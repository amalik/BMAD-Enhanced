# Step 2: Evidence Inventory

Now let's take stock of all the evidence you've accumulated. Decisions are only as good as the evidence behind them.

## Your Task

### Artifact Inventory

List all artifacts produced so far, organized by stream:

**Contextualize artifacts:**
- [ ] Product vision document
- [ ] Lean personas
- [ ] Problem space definition
- [ ] Other: {list}

**Empathize artifacts:**
- [ ] Empathy maps
- [ ] User interview findings
- [ ] Discovery research synthesis
- [ ] Other: {list}

**Externalize artifacts:**
- [ ] Experiment results / learning cards
- [ ] MVP test results
- [ ] Proof of concept findings
- [ ] Proof of value findings
- [ ] Other: {list}

**Systematize artifacts:**
- [ ] Learning cards
- [ ] Pivot/patch/persevere decisions
- [ ] Previous navigation recommendations
- [ ] Other: {list}

### Evidence Quality Assessment

For each piece of evidence, rate its quality:

| Artifact | Source | Age | Sample Size | Quality |
|----------|--------|-----|-------------|---------|
| {name} | {research/experiment/assumption} | {days/weeks} | {n=?} | {strong/moderate/weak} |

### Key Learnings Summary

What are the top 5 things you've learned so far?

1. {learning 1} — Evidence: {source}
2. {learning 2} — Evidence: {source}
3. {learning 3} — Evidence: {source}
4. {learning 4} — Evidence: {source}
5. {learning 5} — Evidence: {source}

## Your Turn

Complete the artifact inventory and evidence quality assessment. Don't count assumptions as evidence -- only include things backed by research, experiments, or data.
