# Step 2: Problem Context & Opportunity Mapping

Now that we have a validated problem definition, let's unpack it and map the opportunity space for hypothesis generation.

## Why This Matters

Structured brainwriting produces better ideas than unstructured brainstorming — but only if you start from a deep understanding of the problem space. Before we generate a single hypothesis, we need to see the full landscape: which pains are screaming for solutions, which gains represent the biggest behavioral shifts, and where the assumptions in the problem definition create openings for bold, testable bets.

## Your Task

### 1. Unpack the Problem Definition

Let's extract the key elements from your HC2 artifact (or equivalent input):

**Core Problem:**
- What is the converged problem statement?
- What is the confidence level (High/Medium/Low)?
- What is explicitly in and out of scope?

**Jobs-to-be-Done:**
- What is the primary JTBD? (When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome])
- What functional, emotional, and social jobs are at play?

**Pains & Gains:**
- Which pains are highest priority? Which are most frequent or intense?
- Which gains are most desired? Which have the highest expected impact?
- Where do pains and gains cluster around the same JTBD?

**Evidence & Assumptions:**
- How strong is the evidence base? How many artifacts, how many evidence points?
- What contradictions exist in the evidence?
- What assumptions were flagged? Which are highest risk?
- Where are the evidence gaps?

### 2. Map the Hypothesis Landscape

Based on the unpacked problem definition, let's identify the opportunity space:

| Dimension | Your Assessment |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Strongest opportunities** | Which pain-gain combinations suggest the clearest hypothesis targets? |
| **Riskiest areas** | Where are assumptions most dangerous (high lethality, high uncertainty)? |
| **Evidence strength** | Where is evidence strongest? Where are we flying blind? |
| **Behavioral shift potential** | Which pains, if solved, would create the most visible behavior change? |
| **Bold vs. safe territory** | What's the safe, obvious hypothesis? What's the bold version? |

What if we looked at this from a completely different angle? Consider:
- What would happen if the **opposite** of the problem statement were true?
- Which pain is everyone assuming is the biggest — and what if it's not?
- Where is the evidence **suspiciously** unanimous? (Consensus can hide blind spots)

### 3. Prioritize Hypothesis Targets

Based on your landscape mapping, identify 1-3 hypothesis targets to pursue in Step 3:

| # | Target Pain/Gain | Why This One | Evidence Strength | Bold Factor |
|---|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 | *Most promising target* | *Why it deserves a hypothesis* | High/Medium/Low | Safe / Bold / Radical |
| 2 | *(optional)* | | | |
| 3 | *(optional)* | | | |

**Guidance:** Start with the target that has the strongest evidence AND the highest bold factor. That's a safe bet — what's the bold version? Push yourself to include at least one hypothesis target that challenges the obvious answer.
