# Step 4: Envision Future State

What does success look like 3-5 years from now?

## Why This Matters

A vision without a future state is just a feature list. Envisioning the future:
- Inspires the team (gets people excited about where we're going)
- Guides strategy (ensures today's decisions move toward that future)
- Helps prioritize (does this feature get us closer to the vision?)
- Creates alignment (everyone sees the same destination)

## Your Task

Answer these questions about your future state:

### 1. Where are we headed? (3-5 years)
Paint a picture of the future. What has changed? What impact have you created?

### 2. What does success look like?
- For users? (How has their life/work improved?)
- For your business? (Revenue? Users? Market position?)
- For the market? (What shift did you create?)

### 3. Key milestones along the way?
What are the major checkpoints on the path to that future?

### 4. What capabilities will you have built?
Not features - capabilities. What will you be uniquely good at?

### 5. How will the world be different?
What will be possible that isn't possible today?

### 6. What's your North Star metric?
The one metric that best captures progress toward this vision?

## Example

**Future State (3-5 Years):**
Team status anxiety is a thing of the past. Engineering managers at 10,000+ high-growth companies have real-time confidence in their team's progress without ever asking for status updates.

**Success Looks Like:**

**For Users:**
- Managers spend <5 min/day on status (vs. current 30-60 min)
- Zero manual status updates required from team
- Proactive alerts prevent 80% of deadline surprises
- Manager confidence score: 9/10 (vs. current 4/10)

**For Business:**
- $50M ARR, growing 100% YoY
- 10,000+ distributed engineering teams using the platform
- Category leader in "Automated Team Intelligence"
- 40% market share of Series A-C startup engineering teams

**For Market:**
- "Status meeting" becomes quaint relic (like fax machines)
- Industry standard: Teams produce status signals, AI interprets them
- Adjacent markets emerge (automated planning, predictive resource allocation)

**Key Milestones:**
- **Year 1:** 100 teams, product-market fit, $1M ARR
- **Year 2:** 1,000 teams, category creation, $10M ARR
- **Year 3:** 5,000 teams, enterprise expansion, $25M ARR
- **Year 4-5:** 10,000+ teams, market leadership, $50M+ ARR

**Capabilities We'll Build:**
- Best-in-class integrations with engineering tools
- Most accurate AI models for predicting software delivery
- Largest dataset of engineering workflow patterns
- Fastest time-to-insight (real-time, not batch)

**World Differently:**
- Engineering managers focus on coaching, not tracking
- Teams focus on building, not reporting
- Proactive planning replaces reactive firefighting
- Distributed teams are MORE visible than co-located teams (paradox!)

**North Star Metric:**
**Manager Confidence Score** - Daily measure of "How confident are you that your team is on track?" (Target: 9/10 average)

## Your Turn

Envision your future state using the structure above.

**Tip:** Make it inspiring but believable. "We'll replace all software engineers with AI" isn't believable. "We'll save engineering managers 10 hours/week" is believable and inspiring.
