# Step 1: List Problem Opportunities

What problems could you solve? Let's get them all on the table before deciding.

## Why This Matters

You can't make a good decision without seeing all options. Listing opportunities ensures you don't miss something important.

## Your Task

List 3-7 problem opportunities you could investigate. For each, provide:

### 1. Problem name (short label)
### 2. Problem description (1-2 sentences)
### 3. Who experiences this problem?
### 4. Rough market size estimate
### 5. Initial gut feeling (High/Medium/Low interest)

## Example

**Opportunity A: Team Status Visibility**
- Remote managers lack real-time visibility into distributed team progress
- Managers of 5-20 person distributed software teams
- ~2M teams globally, $15B TAM
- Interest: HIGH

**Opportunity B: Meeting Overload**
- Teams waste 10+ hours/week in unnecessary meetings
- Knowledge workers at companies 50-500 employees
- ~10M workers globally, $50B TAM
- Interest: MEDIUM
