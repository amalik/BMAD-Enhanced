# Step 3: Jobs-to-be-Done Framing

Time to take everything we've analyzed and frame it through the Jobs-to-be-Done lens. This is where scattered findings become an actionable problem statement.

## Why This Matters

JTBD framing turns observations into actionable problem statements. Instead of listing what users do or feel, we define what they're trying to accomplish — and that's what drives solutions. Across all our research, the core problem is always rooted in an unmet job.

## Your Task

### 1. Frame the Primary JTBD

Using the evidence from your artifacts, complete this structure:

> **When** [situation — the triggering context],
> **I want to** [motivation — what the user wants to accomplish],
> **so I can** [expected outcome — the desired end state].

**Tips for Strong JTBD Framing:**
- The **situation** should come directly from your research (observed contexts, interview triggers)
- The **motivation** should reflect what users actually said or did, not what we assume they want
- The **expected outcome** should describe a changed state, not a feature

**Example:**
> **When** I'm managing multiple marketing campaigns across 6 different tools,
> **I want to** see all campaign performance in one place,
> **so I can** make real-time optimization decisions without wasting 2 hours on data consolidation.

### 2. Extract Job Types

From the artifact evidence, identify:

**Functional Job** *(required)*
The practical task the user is trying to accomplish.
- What observable action are they performing?
- What's the measurable outcome they need?

**Emotional Job** *(if evidence supports)*
How the user wants to feel while doing the job.
- What emotions surfaced in interviews or observations?
- What anxieties or frustrations did the research capture?

**Social Job** *(if evidence supports)*
How the user wants to be perceived by others.
- What social dynamics emerged from the research?
- How does the user's role or reputation connect to this job?

### 3. Ground Every Claim in Evidence

For each element of your JTBD, note which artifact supports it:
- "Situation comes from empathy map (artifact 1) — user context section"
- "Motivation from interview synthesis (artifact 2) — direct quote: '...'"
- "Outcome from observation report (artifact 3) — observed behavior"

The data shows that JTBD statements grounded in specific evidence are far more useful than those based on intuition.

## Your Turn

Draft your Primary JTBD statement and identify the Functional, Emotional, and Social jobs. Link each to specific artifact evidence.
