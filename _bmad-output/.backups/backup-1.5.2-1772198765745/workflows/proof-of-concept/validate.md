## Overview

This validation workflow helps you review proof-of-concepts to ensure they answer the technical question without over-engineering.

## What Gets Validated

- Is the technical question clearly stated?
- Is the approach appropriate (not over-engineered)?
- Are implementation details documented?
- Are results based on evidence?
- Is the feasibility decision justified?
- Does this focus on learning over production quality?

## Coming in v1.2.0

This validation workflow will be available alongside the proof-of-concept workflow in March 2026.
