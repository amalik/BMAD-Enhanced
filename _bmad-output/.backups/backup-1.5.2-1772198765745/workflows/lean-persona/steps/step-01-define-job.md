# Step 1: Define Job-to-be-Done

Before we create a lean persona, we need to understand the fundamental job your user is trying to accomplish.

## Why This Matters

Jobs-to-be-done is the foundation of lean personas. People don't buy products - they "hire" solutions to get a job done. Understanding the job helps us:
- Focus on behavior, not demographics
- Identify what truly matters to users
- Find better competing solutions we might not have considered
- Design value propositions that resonate

## Your Task

Answer these questions to define the job-to-be-done:

### 1. What job is the user trying to accomplish?
Be specific. Not "manage finances" but "ensure I don't overspend on discretionary purchases each month."

### 2. Give this persona a name
A simple identifier (e.g., "Budget-Conscious Parent", "Efficiency-Driven PM"). This is for reference, not a demographic label.

### 3. How often does this job occur?
- Daily? Weekly? Monthly? Annually?
- Is it predictable or unpredictable?
- How urgent is it when it arises?

### 4. How important is this job to the user?
On a scale: Mission-critical / Very important / Important / Nice-to-have
Why does it matter to them?

### 5. What evidence do you have?
- User interviews? (how many?)
- Surveys? Observations?
- Analytics? Support tickets?
- Or is this a hypothesis to validate?

## Example

**Persona Name:** Time-Strapped Remote Manager

**Job-to-be-Done:** Keep my distributed team aligned on priorities without wasting time in status meetings.

**Frequency:** Daily (checking alignment), Weekly (setting priorities)

**Importance:** Mission-critical - Team misalignment directly impacts delivery and morale

**Evidence:**
- 5 user interviews with remote team managers
- Analysis of 100+ support tickets about "meeting overload"
- Survey of 200 remote managers (68% cited "too many meetings" as top frustration)
- HYPOTHESIS: We believe eliminating daily standups would improve team productivity

## Your Turn

Please define the job-to-be-done using the structure above.

**Important:** If you're working from a hypothesis (not validated research), clearly mark assumptions. Every assumption needs a plan to validate it.

When you've defined the job and I've confirmed it's specific enough, I'll load:
