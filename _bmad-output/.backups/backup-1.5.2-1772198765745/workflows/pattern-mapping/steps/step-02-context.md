# Step 2: Context Loading & Analysis

Now that we know what artifacts we're working with, let's load them all and understand what each one individually reveals before we start looking for cross-artifact patterns.

## Why This Matters

Before you can see patterns across artifacts, you need to understand what each artifact says on its own. The data shows that rushing to cross-artifact comparison without per-artifact analysis leads to shallow pattern identification. Take the time to understand each piece before looking at the whole picture.

## Your Task

### 1. Load All Input Artifacts

Read through each of your input artifacts completely. Don't skim — the details matter for pattern identification.

For each artifact, note:
- **Who** was researched (user segments, personas, interview subjects)
- **What** was discovered (key findings, insights, themes)
- **How strong** the evidence is (direct quotes, observed behavior, survey data, or assumptions)
- **Themes identified** within this single artifact
- **Contradictions** with other artifacts (if you notice any while reading)

### 2. Per-Artifact Analysis

For each artifact, build a brief analysis note. Here's the structure:

**Artifact: [Name/Path]**
- **Source:** [Who produced it, when, using what method]
- **Scope:** [Who was researched, what was studied]
- **Top 3 Findings:** [The strongest insights from this artifact]
- **Evidence Strength:** Strong (direct quotes/observed behavior) / Moderate (survey data/indirect evidence) / Weak (assumptions/anecdotal)
- **Initial Themes:** [Themes this artifact surfaces on its own]

### 3. Establish the Artifact Landscape

Once you've analyzed each artifact individually, summarize the landscape:
- **Strongest individual artifact:** Which artifact has the most robust evidence?
- **Broadest coverage:** Which artifact covers the most ground?
- **Most surprising content:** What did you find that you didn't expect?
- **Obvious overlaps:** Even before formal pattern identification, what topics appear in multiple artifacts?

## Example Per-Artifact Analysis

**From 2 artifacts** (empathy map + interview synthesis):

**Artifact 1: HC1 Empathy Map — Busy Parents Segment**
- **Source:** Isla's empathy-map workflow, 2026-02-20
- **Scope:** 12 busy parents, ages 28-42, dual-income households
- **Top 3 Findings:** (1) Morning routine is the highest-stress period; (2) Parents build workarounds for meal planning; (3) "I just want someone to tell me it's okay to not do everything"
- **Evidence Strength:** Strong — direct quotes from empathy mapping sessions
- **Initial Themes:** Time pressure, decision fatigue, guilt

**Artifact 2: HC1 Interview Synthesis — Working Parents**
- **Source:** Isla's user-interview workflow, 2026-02-21
- **Scope:** 8 working parents, semi-structured interviews, 45 min each
- **Top 3 Findings:** (1) 6 of 8 participants mention morning routine as pain point; (2) Existing tools feel designed for "people with more time"; (3) Partner coordination is a hidden complexity layer
- **Evidence Strength:** Strong — direct quotes, behavioral observations
- **Initial Themes:** Time pressure, tool inadequacy, coordination overhead

**Artifact Landscape:**
- **Strongest evidence:** Artifact 2 (longer interviews, richer quotes)
- **Broadest coverage:** Artifact 1 (more participants, wider demographic)
- **Most surprising:** Partner coordination theme — appeared strongly in interviews but was absent from empathy map
- **Obvious overlaps:** Time pressure and morning routine pain appear in both

## Your Turn

Walk me through your per-artifact analysis. What does each artifact independently reveal? Three patterns converge on this insight — but first we need to understand the parts before we see the whole.

When we've established the per-artifact landscape, I'll load:
