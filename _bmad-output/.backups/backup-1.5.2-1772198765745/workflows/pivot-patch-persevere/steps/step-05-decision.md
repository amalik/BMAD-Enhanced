# Step 5: Decision

Now we make the decision. This step forces you to commit clearly, document the rationale, and define what would make you revisit the decision.

## Why This Matters

A decision without clear rationale is just a guess. A decision without reversal criteria becomes dogma. This step ensures your decision is:
- **Explicit** - Everyone knows what was decided and why
- **Evidence-based** - Grounded in the analysis from previous steps
- **Reversible** - You know what signals would cause you to reconsider
- **Time-bound** - There's a checkpoint to reassess

## Your Task

### 1. State the Decision

**Decision:** PIVOT / PATCH / PERSEVERE

**One-sentence summary:** "We are choosing to [pivot/patch/persevere] by [specific action] because [core rationale]."

### 2. Document the Rationale

**Primary reasons for this decision (evidence-based):**
1. {Reason 1 with supporting evidence}
2. {Reason 2 with supporting evidence}
3. {Reason 3 with supporting evidence}

**Why NOT the other options:**

If choosing Pivot:
- Why not Patch? {reason with evidence}
- Why not Persevere? {reason with evidence}

If choosing Patch:
- Why not Pivot? {reason with evidence}
- Why not Persevere? {reason with evidence}

If choosing Persevere:
- Why not Pivot? {reason with evidence}
- Why not Patch? {reason with evidence}

### 3. Acknowledge What You're Betting On

Every decision is a bet. Be explicit about yours:

**We are betting that:**
- {Assumption 1 that must hold for this to work}
- {Assumption 2 that must hold}
- {Assumption 3 that must hold}

**We are accepting these risks:**
- {Risk 1 and why we're accepting it}
- {Risk 2 and why we're accepting it}

**We are giving up:**
- {Opportunity cost 1}
- {Opportunity cost 2}

### 4. Define Reversal Criteria

Under what conditions would you revisit this decision?

**KILL criteria (would trigger a full re-evaluation):**
- {Specific, measurable signal that means this decision was wrong}
- {Another specific signal}
- Timeline: If these signals appear within {timeframe}, we reconvene

**CONCERN criteria (would trigger a check-in but not necessarily reversal):**
- {Specific, measurable signal that means things aren't going as planned}
- {Another specific signal}
- Response: If these appear, we {specific action}

**Examples of good reversal criteria:**
- "If patch experiment shows <60% adoption after 4 weeks with champion onboarding, we revisit"
- "If we can't identify 50+ qualified prospects in the narrowed market within 3 weeks, the TAM concern is real"
- "If the team champion role creates resentment or burnout in 2+ pilot teams, the mechanism is flawed"

**Examples of bad reversal criteria (too vague):**
- "If things don't work out"
- "If the market shifts"
- "If we feel it's not working"

### 5. Rate Decision Confidence

**Confidence level:** HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

**What would increase your confidence:**
- {Specific evidence or event that would make you more certain}
- {Another factor}

**Decision quality assessment:**
| Factor | Rating | Note |
|--------|--------|------|
| Evidence completeness | {Good/Fair/Poor} | {gaps} |
| Analysis rigor | {Good/Fair/Poor} | {limitations} |
| Stakeholder alignment | {Strong/Moderate/Weak} | {dissents} |
| Reversibility | {High/Medium/Low} | {what's hard to undo} |

### 6. Record Dissenting Views

If any stakeholders disagree with the decision, record their views here. This is not optional -- dissenting views are the most valuable part of a decision record because they're the first thing you'll re-read if the decision turns out to be wrong.

**Dissenting view from {stakeholder}:**
- They preferred: {option}
- Their reasoning: {why}
- Their concern about chosen direction: {specific worry}
- Conditions under which they'd be proven right: {signals to watch}

## Example

**Decision:** PATCH

**Summary:** "We are choosing to patch by narrowing our target market to distributed teams with 3+ timezones and adding champion onboarding, because the problem is validated but our solution needs these specific adjustments to achieve sustainable adoption."

**Rationale:**
1. Problem layer is strong (5+ hours/week pain confirmed, High confidence) -- no reason to pivot away from the problem
2. Solution works under specific conditions (champion + distributed = 91% adoption) -- the failure was targeting, not concept
3. Patch is testable in 4-6 weeks vs. 3-4 months for a pivot -- we preserve optionality

**Why not Pivot:** Our problem hypotheses are validated. Pivoting would abandon confirmed insights (remote manager pain, willingness to pay) to chase unvalidated new direction.

**Why not Persevere:** Evidence clearly shows co-located teams don't benefit and adoption without champions fails. Continuing the broad approach ignores data.

**We are betting that:**
- The champion role can be reliably onboarded (not just organic)
- Distributed teams with 3+ timezones are a large enough market
- 4-week adoption rates will stabilize after initial novelty drop

**Reversal Criteria:**

KILL: If patched experiment shows <65% adoption at 4 weeks with champion onboarding, the champion mechanism is insufficient. Re-evaluate all options.

CONCERN: If TAM analysis shows fewer than 500 qualified companies, market may be too small. Consider broadening to 2+ timezones.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM -- Evidence supports the patch direction but key assumptions (champion onboarding, market size) are untested.

**Dissenting view (Sam, Sales):**
- Preferred: Wanted to test broader market before narrowing
- Reasoning: "Narrowing too early might cause us to miss adjacent segments"
- Concern: TAM too small for venture-scale business
- They'd be proven right if: TAM analysis returns <200 qualified companies

## Your Turn

Please make and document your decision using the structure above.

**Key principle:** A good decision is not one that turns out to be right. It's one that was made with the best available evidence, documented clearly, and is revisable when new evidence appears.
