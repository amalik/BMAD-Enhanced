# Step 6: Create Navigation Plan

Let's turn the recommendation into an actionable plan with clear next steps, timeline, and success criteria.

## Your Task

### Navigation Plan

**Target stream:** {recommended stream}
**Agent to activate:** {agent name and file}
**Estimated duration:** {timeframe}

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **First action:** {what to do right now}
   - Agent/workflow: {which agent and workflow to use}
   - Expected output: {deliverable}

2. **Second action:** {next step}
   - Agent/workflow: {which agent and workflow}
   - Expected output: {deliverable}

3. **Third action:** {following step}
   - Agent/workflow: {which agent and workflow}
   - Expected output: {deliverable}

### Resources Needed

- [ ] {resource 1 -- e.g., "Access to 5 target users for interviews"}
- [ ] {resource 2 -- e.g., "Analytics dashboard access"}
- [ ] {resource 3}

### Checkpoints

**Checkpoint 1** (after {timeframe}):
- Check: {what to evaluate}
- If on track: continue
- If off track: {adjustment}

**Checkpoint 2** (after {timeframe}):
- Check: {what to evaluate}
- If sufficient evidence gathered: move to next stream
- If insufficient: extend or pivot approach

### Re-navigation Triggers

Come back to Vortex Navigation if:
- [ ] A major assumption is invalidated
- [ ] The team discovers a new critical gap
- [ ] The recommended stream produces unexpected insights
- [ ] External conditions change significantly
- [ ] {custom trigger}

## Synthesize

Now let's create the final navigation recommendation artifact using the template.

**Output file:** `{output_folder}/vortex-navigation-{date}.md`

Fill in the template with all decisions made during this workflow.

**Reminder:** Navigation is not a one-time activity. As you progress through the recommended stream and generate new evidence, revisit this workflow to recalibrate your direction. The Vortex is iterative by design.
