**Agent:** Wade (Lean Experiments Specialist)

**Stream:** Externalize

## Overview

This validation workflow helps you review proof-of-values to ensure they test real user value, not just feature interest.

## What Gets Validated

- Is the value hypothesis specific and testable?
- Are target users clearly defined?
- Is the validation approach appropriate?
- Are results based on actual user feedback?
- Is the business case justified by evidence?
- Does this test value perception, not just feature desirability?

## Coming in v1.2.0

This validation workflow will be available alongside the proof-of-value workflow in March 2026.
