# Step 2: Current Solution Analysis

Now that we know the job, let's understand how users solve it today - and what's broken about that solution.

## Why This Matters

Your product isn't competing with nothing - it's competing with how users currently solve this problem. Understanding their current solution reveals:
- What they value (they're paying with time, money, or frustration)
- Where the opportunities are (what's broken)
- What habits you'll need to break (switching costs)
- How good "good enough" needs to be

## Your Task

Answer these questions about the current solution:

### 1. How do they solve this job today?
Describe their current approach in detail. What tools/methods/processes do they use?

### 2. What are the pain points with the current solution?
List 3-5 specific frustrations. Be concrete.
- Not: "It's slow"
- But: "Takes 15+ minutes to generate a weekly report that should take 2 minutes"

### 3. What workarounds or hacks have they created?
Users are creative. What unofficial solutions have they cobbled together?

### 4. What does the current solution cost them?
- Time (hours per week/month)?
- Money (subscriptions, licenses, tools)?
- Opportunity cost (what can't they do because of this)?
- Frustration/stress?

### 5. Why haven't they switched already?
If it's so painful, what keeps them using the current solution?

## Example

**Current Solution:**
Weekly status meetings + scattered Slack messages + Google Doc tracking sheet

**Pain Points:**
1. Status meetings take 1 hour but only 10 minutes is relevant to any individual
2. Important updates get lost in Slack noise
3. Google Doc always out of date - no one updates it consistently
4. No visibility between weekly meetings if something goes off track

**Workarounds:**
- Manager manually DMs each team member daily for quick updates (adds 30 min/day)
- Team created private #urgent-only Slack channel (but not everyone checks it)
- Some teams use Linear/Jira but half the team ignores it

**Current Cost:**
- Time: 5 hours/week (1hr meeting + 2.5hrs prep/DMs + 1.5hrs chasing updates)
- Money: $0 (using free tools)
- Opportunity cost: Can't proactively spot blockers, only reactively fix problems
- Frustration: HIGH - "I spend more time tracking work than doing work"

**Why Haven't They Switched:**
- Free tools are "good enough"
- Tried 3 project management tools, team resisted all of them
- Learning new tools takes time they don't have
- Worried about making things more complicated, not simpler

## Your Turn

Please analyze the current solution using the structure above.

**Tip:** If users say "there is no current solution," they're wrong. There's ALWAYS a current solution, even if it's "ignore the problem" or "manually do it."
