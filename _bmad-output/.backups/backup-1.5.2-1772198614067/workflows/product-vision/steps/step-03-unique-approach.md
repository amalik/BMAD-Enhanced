# Step 3: Articulate Unique Approach

What makes your solution different from (and better than) the alternatives?

## Why This Matters

If your approach isn't meaningfully different, you're just another commodity in a crowded market. Your unique approach:
- Gives people a reason to switch from their current solution
- Creates defensibility (hard to copy)
- Guides your product strategy
- Becomes the core of your positioning and messaging

## Your Task

Answer these questions about your unique approach:

### 1. What's your core insight?
What do you understand about the problem/solution that others don't?

### 2. What makes your approach different?
How does your solution differ from existing alternatives?

### 3. Why is your approach better?
For your target users, what advantage does your approach provide?

### 4. What's your unfair advantage?
What do you have (or can build) that's hard for competitors to replicate?
- Team expertise?
- Proprietary data/technology?
- Strategic partnerships?
- Network effects?

### 5. Why now?
What's changed that makes your approach possible or necessary now?

### 6. What trade-offs are you making?
Every approach has trade-offs. What are you optimizing for (and what are you sacrificing)?

## Example

**Core Insight:**
Team status shouldn't require manual updates or scheduled meetings - it should be automatically inferred from the team's existing workflow.

**Different Approach:**
Instead of asking teams to update another tool, we automatically aggregate signals from their existing tools (GitHub, Linear, Slack) to provide real-time status.

**Why Better:**
- **Zero overhead** - Team doesn't change their workflow
- **Real-time** - Updates instantly as work happens, not weekly
- **Proactive** - Surfaces problems before they're crises
- **Accurate** - Based on actual work, not what people remember to report

**Unfair Advantage:**
- Deep expertise in distributed systems (founding team from Datadog, New Relic)
- Existing integration partnerships with GitHub, Linear, Slack
- AI/ML models trained on 50K+ engineering teams' workflow patterns
- Network effects: More teams = better pattern recognition

**Why Now:**
- Remote work explosion created urgent need for passive visibility
- Modern tools have APIs (possible to aggregate signals)
- AI/ML maturity makes pattern recognition feasible
- Gen Z engineers refuse to "update another tool"

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ **Optimizing for:** Zero-overhead for team, real-time accuracy
- ❌ **Sacrificing:** Fine-grained control (trusting automation), works only for teams using integrated tools, requires AI investment

## Your Turn

Articulate your unique approach using the structure above.

**Tip:** If your approach is "better UX" or "easier to use," that's not differentiated enough. WHY is it better? WHAT specifically makes it easier?
