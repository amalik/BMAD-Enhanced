# Step 2: Design Interview Script

Now that you have clear research goals, let's design an interview script that draws out honest, detailed responses without leading participants toward the answers you want to hear.

## Why This Matters

The quality of your insights depends entirely on the quality of your questions. Leading questions produce false confidence. Closed questions produce shallow data. A well-designed script helps you:
- Get authentic stories instead of socially desirable answers
- Uncover behaviors (what people actually do) not just opinions (what people say they'd do)
- Maintain consistency across interviews while leaving room for exploration
- Avoid the most common interview pitfalls that waste everyone's time

## Question Design Principles

### The Five Rules of Interview Questions

1. **Ask about the past, not the future.** "Tell me about the last time you..." beats "Would you ever...?" People are terrible at predicting their own behavior.

2. **Ask open-ended questions.** Questions that can be answered with "yes" or "no" kill conversations. Start with "Tell me about...", "Walk me through...", "Describe...", "What happened when..."

3. **Never lead the witness.** "Don't you think the onboarding is confusing?" will always get a "yes." Instead: "Walk me through your first experience with the product."

4. **Follow emotion and energy.** When a participant's voice changes, they lean forward, or they hesitate -- that's where the real insight lives. Probe deeper there.

5. **Separate behavior from opinion.** "Do you like using spreadsheets?" (opinion) vs. "How many hours last week did you spend in spreadsheets?" (behavior). Behavior is more reliable.

### Common Bias Traps to Avoid

| Bias Trap | Example (Bad) | Fix (Good) |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Leading question | "How frustrating is the checkout process?" | "Walk me through your last purchase." |
| Hypothetical | "Would you use a feature that does X?" | "How do you handle X today?" |
| Binary question | "Is the dashboard useful?" | "How do you use the dashboard in your daily work?" |
| Stacking questions | "What do you think about the price and the features and the design?" | Ask one question at a time. |
| Priming | "We built this feature to save time. How much time does it save you?" | "Tell me about your experience with this feature." |

## Your Task

Design your interview script using the structure below:

### 1. Opening (2-3 minutes)

Write a brief introduction that:
- Thanks the participant for their time
- Explains the purpose (in general terms, without biasing)
- Sets expectations (duration, recording permission, no right/wrong answers)
- Asks permission to take notes or record

**Example opening:**
> "Thank you for taking the time to talk with me today. I'm researching how [role/persona] handle [general topic]. There are no right or wrong answers -- I'm genuinely curious about your experience. This will take about 30-45 minutes. Is it okay if I take notes? Everything you share will be kept confidential."

### 2. Warm-up Questions (3-5 minutes)

Start with easy, non-threatening questions to build rapport and get context.

**Examples:**
- "Tell me about your role. What does a typical day look like?"
- "How long have you been doing [activity/role]?"
- "What tools or processes do you use most in your work?"

### 3. Core Questions (20-30 minutes)

These are your main research questions. Design 5-8 core questions tied directly to your research goals.

**For each question, include:**
- The main question
- 2-3 follow-up probes if the answer is shallow
- What you're trying to learn (internal note, not shared with participant)

**Example format:**
> **Q: "Walk me through the last time you [relevant activity]."**
> - Probe: "What happened next?"
> - Probe: "How did that make you feel?"
> - Probe: "What did you try before that?"
> - *Learning goal: Understand the real workflow and pain points*

### 4. Closing Questions (5 minutes)

Wrap up with reflective and forward-looking questions:
- "Is there anything I should have asked but didn't?"
- "What's the one thing you wish was different about [topic]?"
- "Is there anyone else you think I should talk to about this?"

### 5. Debrief Notes (post-interview, for interviewer only)

After each interview, immediately capture:
- Top 3 surprising things you heard
- Quotes that stood out
- Body language or emotional moments
- What would you ask differently next time?

## Script Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify your script passes these checks:

- [ ] Every core question is open-ended (cannot be answered yes/no)
- [ ] No question contains the answer you're hoping to hear
- [ ] Questions focus on past behavior, not future predictions
- [ ] You ask about specific instances ("last time") not generalizations ("usually")
- [ ] Questions progress from easy/broad to specific/deep
- [ ] You have probes ready for shallow answers
- [ ] The script can be completed in the planned time
- [ ] You have not revealed your product idea or solution before asking about problems

## Your Turn

Please design your interview script using the structure above. I'll review it for leading questions, bias, and alignment with your research goals.

**Tip:** The best interviews feel like conversations, not interrogations. Your script is a guide, not a rigid questionnaire. Be prepared to deviate when the participant says something interesting.
