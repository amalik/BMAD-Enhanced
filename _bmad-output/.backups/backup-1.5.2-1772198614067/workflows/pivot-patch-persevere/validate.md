# Validate Existing PPP Decision

Bring me a pivot/patch/persevere decision record and I'll help you assess whether the evidence basis is sound, the rationale is logical, and the action plan is complete.

## Why Validation Matters

Strategic decisions have outsized impact. A poorly reasoned pivot wastes months of validated learning. A stubborn persevere burns runway on a failed approach. Validation ensures your PPP decision is rigorous enough to bet the company's next quarter on.

## Validation Process

### 1. Evidence Basis Check

**Is the evidence comprehensive?**
- Are all relevant learning cards cited?
- Is there both quantitative and qualitative evidence?
- Are evidence gaps acknowledged?
- Are STAY, CHANGE, and UNCLEAR signals all represented?

**Red Flags:**
- Decision based on a single experiment or data point
- Only evidence supporting the chosen option is cited
- Evidence gaps are not acknowledged
- Market and competitive signals are missing
- No customer evidence (only internal opinions)

### 2. Hypothesis Assessment Check

**Is the hypothesis stack complete?**
- Problem, solution, AND business layers assessed?
- Each hypothesis has a clear status with evidence?
- Foundational vs. adjustable hypotheses are distinguished?
- Health score calculation is accurate?

**Red Flags:**
- Only testing problem hypotheses (ignoring solution and business viability)
- Status assigned without supporting evidence
- "Confirmed" status with low-confidence evidence
- Untested hypotheses treated as confirmed by default

### 3. Option Analysis Check

**Were all three options seriously considered?**

The most important validation question: Can you articulate strong arguments FOR the rejected options?

**Check for each option:**
- Are the pros genuine advantages (not strawmen)?
- Are the cons specific and evidence-based?
- Is the resource cost realistic?
- Is the confidence rating defensible?

**Red Flags:**
- One option clearly has more detailed analysis than others (the chosen one)
- Pros of rejected options are dismissive or vague
- Cons of the chosen option are minimized
- No comparative summary
- Confidence ratings don't match the evidence presented

### 4. Decision Rationale Check

**Does the decision logically follow from the analysis?**
- Each reason cites specific evidence
- Rejection of other options is evidence-based, not emotional
- Bets and risks are explicitly acknowledged
- Opportunity costs are identified

**Red Flags:**
- "We decided to persevere because we believe in our vision" (belief is not evidence)
- Reasons don't reference the analysis from previous steps
- No acknowledgment of what could go wrong
- Dissenting views are absent or dismissed

### 5. Action Plan Completeness Check

**Is the action plan executable?**

| Requirement | Present? | Quality |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| Immediate actions with owners and dates | {Yes/No} | {Specific/Vague} |
| Next experiment with hypothesis and success criteria | {Yes/No} | {Rigorous/Weak} |
| Communication plan | {Yes/No} | {Complete/Partial} |
| Resource allocation | {Yes/No} | {Realistic/Optimistic} |
| Success metrics (leading and lagging) | {Yes/No} | {Measurable/Vague} |
| Checkpoint schedule | {Yes/No} | {Specific/Generic} |
| Risk mitigation | {Yes/No} | {Actionable/Theoretical} |

**Red Flags:**
- Actions without owners ("the team will...")
- No dates or deadlines
- Success criteria defined after seeing results
- No reversal criteria (the decision is treated as permanent)
- No next experiment (decision is end point, not learning cycle)

### 6. Bias Check

**Common biases in PPP decisions:**

| Bias | How to Detect | Present? |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Sunk cost | Rationale mentions "investment so far" | {Yes/No} |
| Confirmation | Only favorable evidence cited | {Yes/No} |
| Authority | Decision follows highest-ranking opinion | {Yes/No} |
| Anchoring | First option considered gets most analysis | {Yes/No} |
| Loss aversion | Risk of change is overweighted vs. risk of staying | {Yes/No} |
| Groupthink | No dissenting views recorded | {Yes/No} |

## Your Turn

**Please share:**
1. The PPP decision record you want to validate (paste content or provide file path)
2. Optionally: the learning cards that informed the decision

I'll review it and provide:
- **Evidence score** - Is the evidence base strong enough for this decision?
- **Logic score** - Does the decision follow from the analysis?
- **Completeness score** - Is the action plan executable?
- **Bias assessment** - Are common decision biases present?
- **Overall validation rating** - Decision-ready / Needs revision / Insufficient basis
- **Specific improvement suggestions** - Exactly what to strengthen and how

## Validation Rating Scale

**Decision-Ready:**
- Evidence is comprehensive with gaps acknowledged
- All three options were rigorously analyzed
- Decision logically follows from evidence
- Dissenting views are documented
- Action plan is specific, owned, and time-bound
- Reversal criteria are measurable
- This decision can be confidently communicated to stakeholders

**Needs Revision:**
- Evidence has gaps that should be filled before deciding
- Option analysis is uneven (favored option got more rigor)
- Rationale has logical leaps
- Action plan lacks specificity
- Fix the identified issues, then re-evaluate the decision

**Insufficient Basis:**
- Evidence is too thin for the magnitude of the decision
- Key hypotheses are untested
- Option analysis is superficial
- Decision appears predetermined rather than evidence-driven
- Gather more evidence before making this decision
