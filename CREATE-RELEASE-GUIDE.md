# How to Create GitHub Release v1.0.2-alpha

## Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Go to the releases page:**
   https://github.com/amalik/BMAD-Enhanced/releases/new

2. **Fill in the form:**
   - **Tag version:** `v1.0.2-alpha`
   - **Target:** `main`
   - **Release title:** `BMAD-Enhanced v1.0.2-alpha - Bug Fixes`
   - **Description:** Copy the contents from `RELEASE-NOTES-v1.0.2-alpha.md`
   - **Check:** ✅ "This is a pre-release"

3. **Publish release**

## Option 2: Using gh CLI (After Authentication)

First, authenticate with GitHub:
```bash
gh auth login
```

Then create the release:
```bash
gh release create v1.0.2-alpha \
  --title "BMAD-Enhanced v1.0.2-alpha - Bug Fixes" \
  --notes-file RELEASE-NOTES-v1.0.2-alpha.md \
  --prerelease \
  --target main
```

## Option 3: Push First, Then Create Release

If you need to push the commits first:
```bash
# Push commits to GitHub
git push

# Then create release using one of the methods above
```
