# Proof of Concept Workflow

**Status:** Coming in v1.2.0

**Agent:** Wade (Lean Experiments Specialist)

**Stream:** Externalize

## Overview

This workflow helps you validate technical feasibility before investing in full development. A proof-of-concept answers: "Can we actually build this?"

## What You'll Create

A proof-of-concept artifact that captures:
- Technical question being answered
- Approach and technology choices
- Implementation details (prototype/spike)
- Results and findings
- Feasibility assessment (go/no-go)

## Workflow Steps

This workflow will guide you through 5 steps:

1. **Define Technical Question** - What are you trying to prove is possible?
2. **Choose Approach** - What's the fastest way to test feasibility?
3. **Build Prototype** - Create minimal technical spike
4. **Evaluate Results** - Did it work? What did you learn?
5. **Make Decision** - Is this technically feasible? Proceed or pivot?

## Coming Soon

This workflow is currently in development and will be available in BMAD-Enhanced v1.2.0 (planned for March 2026).

### What's Being Built

- Step-by-step guided workflow
- Technical spike templates
- Feasibility evaluation framework
- Integration with mvp and proof-of-value workflows
- Sample proof-of-concepts for reference

### Why Wait?

Proof-of-concept is a critical validation step that bridges technical feasibility and business value. We're ensuring:
- Clear distinction between proof-of-concept (can we build it?) and proof-of-value (should we build it?)
- Integration with BMAD core agents for implementation handoff
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Temporary Alternative

While waiting for v1.2.0, you can use Wade's chat mode to plan proof-of-concepts:

```bash
# Activate Wade
cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/lean-experiments-specialist.md

# Select chat mode and ask:
"Help me design a proof-of-concept for [technical question]"
```
