# Step 1: Define the Problem

Before envisioning the solution, we need crystal clarity on the problem we're solving.

## Why This Matters

A great product starts with a deep understanding of a meaningful problem. Without clarity on the problem:
- You'll build features nobody needs
- You won't know if you're making progress
- You can't articulate why your product should exist
- You'll struggle to say "no" to distractions

## Your Task

Answer these questions to define the problem:

### 1. What's the core problem?
Be specific. One sentence that captures the essence of what's broken.

### 2. Who experiences this problem?
Not "everyone" - be specific about who feels this pain most acutely.

### 3. Why does this problem matter?
What's the impact? Cost? Frustration? Missed opportunity?

### 4. How big is this problem?
- How many people experience it?
- How often?
- What's the total market opportunity?

### 5. What evidence do you have?
- User research? Market data?
- Personal experience?
- Industry reports?
- Or is this a hypothesis?

### 6. What alternatives exist today?
How do people solve this now? What's limiting about those solutions?

## Example

**Core Problem:**
Remote team managers lack real-time visibility into team progress, leading to surprises when deadlines are missed.

**Who:**
Managers of 5-20 person distributed software teams in fast-moving startups

**Why It Matters:**
- Missed deadlines damage customer relationships
- Reactive firefighting instead of proactive planning
- Manager anxiety and team frustration from constant status checks
- Estimated $50K-200K annual cost per team in missed opportunities and churn

**Market Size:**
- 2M+ distributed software teams globally
- Growing 25% YoY (remote work acceleration)
- $15B total addressable market (team collaboration tools)

**Evidence:**
- 50 interviews with remote managers
- 75% cited "lack of visibility" as top frustration
- Survey of 500 distributed teams
- Personal experience managing distributed teams for 5 years

**Current Alternatives:**
- Weekly status meetings (time-consuming, lag visibility)
- Slack check-ins (noisy, easy to miss critical updates)
- Project management tools (team doesn't update them consistently)
- **Limitation:** All require manual updates or scheduled check-ins

## Your Turn

Define the problem using the structure above.

**Tip:** If you can't clearly articulate the problem, stop. Don't proceed to building a solution without problem clarity.
