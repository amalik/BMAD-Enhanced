# Step 6: Synthesize

Let's bring it all together into a cohesive product vision document.

## Why This Matters

Your product vision document becomes:
- The alignment tool for your team (everyone sees the same destination)
- The decision-making framework (does this serve the vision?)
- The communication artifact (pitches, hiring, partnerships)
- The strategic anchor (when you drift, come back to this)

## Your Task

Before I generate the final artifact, a few final questions:

### 1. Craft your vision statement (1-2 sentences)

This is the pithy, memorable version. Should be:
- **Aspirational** - Inspiring and ambitious
- **Specific** - Clear about what you're creating
- **Focused** - One clear idea, not three ideas mashed together

**Formula:** For [target users] who [problem], [product] is a [category] that [key benefit]. Unlike [alternatives], our product [unique differentiation].

### 2. Identify your strategic assumptions

What MUST be true for this vision to succeed?

Examples:
- "Remote work will continue to dominate software teams"
- "Engineering managers value time savings over detailed control"
- "Teams will trust AI-generated insights"

Mark each as:
- **CRITICAL** - If this is false, vision fails
- **IMPORTANT** - If this is false, strategy needs adjustment
- **NICE** - Would help but not essential

### 3. Define validation plan

How will you know if you're making progress toward this vision?

- **Metrics to track?**
- **Milestones to hit?**
- **Assumptions to validate first?**
- **Timeline for first validation?**

### 4. Team alignment check

On a scale of 1-10:
- How aligned is the team on this vision?
- What concerns or disagreements remain?
- What questions are still open?

## Example

**Vision Statement:**
"For engineering managers at high-growth startups who waste hours tracking distributed team status, TeamPulse is an automated team intelligence platform that provides real-time confidence without requiring any team overhead. Unlike project management tools that demand manual updates, TeamPulse automatically aggregates workflow signals to surface insights proactively."

**Strategic Assumptions:**

**CRITICAL:**
- Remote/distributed engineering teams will remain dominant (70%+ of Series A-C startups)
- Engineering managers value accuracy + time savings > manual control
- Modern engineering tools will maintain/improve API access

**IMPORTANT:**
- AI inference quality continues to improve (enables better pattern recognition)
- Teams trust automated insights (education/change management needed)
- Integration ecosystem remains accessible (not walled gardens)

**NICE:**
- Async work continues to grow (makes status even harder)
- Economic pressure to do more with less (increases value prop)

**Validation Plan:**

**Metrics to Track:**
- **Week 1-4:** 20 manager interviews - validate problem intensity
- **Month 1-3:** 10-team pilot - validate zero-overhead approach
- **Month 4-6:** $10K MRR - validate willingness to pay
- **Month 7-12:** 100 teams, $100K ARR - validate product-market fit
- **Year 2:** 1,000 teams, $1M ARR - validate scalability

**Assumptions to Validate FIRST:**
1. Managers spend 5+ hours/week on status (interview validation)
2. Teams won't update another tool (pilot validation)
3. AI can accurately infer status from signals (technical validation)

**Timeline:**
- **Weeks 1-4:** Problem validation (interviews)
- **Weeks 5-8:** Technical validation (proof-of-concept)
- **Weeks 9-16:** Solution validation (10-team pilot)
- **Month 4+:** Business model validation (pricing experiments)

**Team Alignment:**

**Alignment Score:** 8/10

**Remaining Concerns:**
- **Tech lead:** "Can we actually build accurate AI models?" → Need PoC
- **Design lead:** "Will managers trust automated insights?" → Need user research
- **Sales lead:** "Is $20/user sustainable pricing?" → Need pricing experiments

**Open Questions:**
- Should we start with GitHub-only integrations or multi-tool from day 1?
- Do we need manager-only insights or should individual contributors see their own data?
- How do we handle teams that don't use integrated tools?

## Your Turn

Please provide:
1. Your vision statement (using the formula)
2. Your strategic assumptions (marked as CRITICAL/IMPORTANT/NICE)
3. Your validation plan with metrics and timeline
4. Your team alignment score and open questions

## Final Step

When you've provided this information, I'll:
1. Generate your complete product vision document
2. Save it to `{output_folder}/product-vision-{product-name}-{date}.md`
3. Create a team alignment summary
4. Suggest next workflows:
   - **lean-persona** to detail your target users
   - **contextualize-scope** to define problem space boundaries
   - **Wade's mvp** to design your minimum viable product

**Remember:** This vision is your north star, not your prison. As you learn, the vision can evolve. But change it deliberately, not drift unconsciously.

## Workflow Complete

After synthesis, your product vision document will include:
- Clear vision statement
- Problem definition
- Target market specificity
- Unique approach and advantages
- Future state (3-5 years)
- Guiding principles
- Strategic assumptions
- Validation plan
- Team alignment status

This becomes your strategic foundation for all product decisions.
