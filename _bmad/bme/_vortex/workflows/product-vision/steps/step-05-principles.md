# Step 5: Align on Principles

What won't you compromise on? What principles guide your decisions?

## Why This Matters

Principles are your decision-making framework when there's no clear answer. They help you:
- Say "no" to tempting but misaligned opportunities
- Make consistent decisions as you scale
- Maintain product integrity
- Align the team on values

Without clear principles, you'll drift or make contradictory decisions.

## Your Task

Answer these questions about your guiding principles:

### 1. What won't you compromise?
Even if it means slower growth or harder sales? What are your non-negotiables?

### 2. What do you say NO to?
Equally important - what will you consciously NOT do?

### 3. What are your core values?
The beliefs that guide how you build and operate?

### 4. How do you make trade-off decisions?
When you must choose between competing goods, what wins?

### 5. What's your product philosophy?
Simple vs. powerful? Open vs. opinionated? Fast vs. perfect?

### 6. What kind of company do you want to build?
Your values shape your culture, which shapes your product.

## Example

**Won't Compromise:**
1. **Zero overhead for engineering teams** - If it adds work for engineers, we won't build it
2. **Privacy & security** - Never sell data, never compromise security for features
3. **Real-time accuracy** - Stale dashboards are useless; we optimize for freshness

**Say NO To:**
- ❌ Manual time-tracking or status updates (violates zero-overhead principle)
- ❌ "Works better with our project management tool" (should work with ANY tool)
- ❌ Gamification/leaderboards (creates wrong incentives, stresses teams)
- ❌ Enterprise-only features (no fragmentation between tiers on core value)

**Core Values:**
- **Respect eng team time** - Managers get value, teams pay no cost
- **Truth over comfort** - Show reality, even if uncomfortable
- **Automation over process** - Technology should reduce overhead, not create it
- **Privacy by design** - Individual work stays private, only team patterns surface

**Trade-off Framework:**
When choosing between:
- **Speed vs. Accuracy** → Accuracy wins (wrong data worse than no data)
- **Simple vs. Powerful** → Simple wins (power users can use APIs)
- **Privacy vs. Insight** → Privacy wins (aggregate patterns, not individual activity)
- **Open vs. Opinionated** → Opinionated wins (best practices baked in)

**Product Philosophy:**
- **Opinionated simplicity** - Strong defaults, easy to start, hard to misconfigure
- **Progressive disclosure** - Simple surface, power underneath
- **Passive intelligence** - Works in background, surfaces insights proactively

**Company We're Building:**
- Remote-first (we're the customer)
- Sustainable growth over hypergrowth
- Engineering-led culture
- Long-term thinking (10-year vision)

## Your Turn

Define your guiding principles using the structure above.

**Tip:** Principles are only useful if they're specific enough to guide decisions. "Quality is important" isn't a principle. "We won't ship features that haven't been tested with 10+ real users" is a principle.
