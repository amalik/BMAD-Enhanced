# Step 2: Identify Target Market

Now that we know the problem, let's get specific about WHO we're serving.

## Why This Matters

"Everyone" is not a target market. Trying to serve everyone means you serve no one well. Being specific about your target market:
- Focuses your messaging and positioning
- Guides product decisions (build for THESE users, not all users)
- Helps you find early adopters
- Makes your vision believable and achievable

## Your Task

Answer these questions about your target market:

### 1. Who is your primary target user?
The MOST important user segment. If you could only serve one group, who would it be?

### 2. What are their characteristics?
- Role/job title?
- Company size/industry?
- Technical sophistication?
- Budget authority?

### 3. Why start with this segment?
- Easiest to reach?
- Feel pain most acutely?
- Willing to pay?
- Will become advocates?

### 4. Secondary target users?
Who else might benefit (but deprioritize for now)?

### 5. Market segments within target?
Any sub-segments with different needs?

### 6. Beachhead strategy?
Where do you start to prove the concept before expanding?

## Example

**Primary Target:**
Engineering managers at Series A-C startups (20-200 employees) managing distributed teams of 5-15 engineers

**Characteristics:**
- **Role:** Engineering Manager, Director of Engineering, VP Engineering
- **Company:** VC-backed startups, product-led, remote-first culture
- **Team Size:** 5-15 direct reports, distributed across 2-4 timezones
- **Tech Stack:** Modern (GitHub, Slack, Linear/Jira)
- **Budget Authority:** $5K-25K annual budget for team tools
- **Pain Intensity:** HIGH - under pressure to ship fast, teams growing quickly

**Why Start Here:**
- Feel pain most acutely (fast growth + distributed teams = visibility crisis)
- Budget to pay for solutions (not hobbyists or freelancers)
- Influencers (speak at conferences, write blogs, shape industry)
- Natural network effects (one manager adopts → tells peers)

**Secondary Targets** (Deprioritize for now):
- Product managers at similar companies
- Tech leads managing cross-functional teams
- Enterprise teams (different needs, slower sales cycles)

**Market Segments:**
- **Segment A:** First-time engineering managers (high pain, low budget)
- **Segment B:** Experienced managers at growing startups (high pain, high budget) ← START HERE
- **Segment C:** Directors/VPs managing managers (different workflow needs)

**Beachhead:**
YC companies (tight community, concentrated in SF/remote, high pain, willing to try new tools, natural advocates)

## Your Turn

Identify your target market using the structure above.

**Tip:** If you find yourself saying "and also this group, and also that group," you're not focused enough. Pick ONE primary target and commit.
