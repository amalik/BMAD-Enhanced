# Product Vision Workflow

**Status:** Coming in v1.2.0

**Agent:** Emma (Contextualization Expert)

**Stream:** Contextualize

## Overview

This workflow helps you define a clear, compelling product vision that aligns your team around the "why" before diving into the "what" or "how."

## What You'll Create

A product vision artifact that captures:
- Vision statement (the future you're creating)
- Problem statement (what's broken today)
- Target users and their jobs-to-be-done
- Success metrics (how you'll know you've succeeded)
- Strategic assumptions (what must be true for this to work)

## Workflow Steps

This workflow will guide you through 5 steps:

1. **Envision the Future** - What world are you trying to create?
2. **Define the Problem** - What's preventing that future today?
3. **Identify Target Users** - Who experiences this problem most acutely?
4. **Define Success** - What metrics prove you've achieved the vision?
5. **Map Assumptions** - What assumptions underpin this vision?

## Coming Soon

This workflow is currently in development and will be available in BMAD-Enhanced v1.2.0 (planned for March 2026).

### What's Being Built

- Step-by-step guided workflow
- Vision canvas template
- Alignment exercises for team workshops
- Integration with contextualize-scope workflow
- Sample product visions for reference

### Why Wait?

We're building a comprehensive strategic framing toolkit that includes:
- Vision definition (this workflow)
- Persona creation (lean-persona)
- Scope decision-making (contextualize-scope)

These workflows need to work together seamlessly, which requires careful design and testing.

## Temporary Alternative

While waiting for v1.2.0, you can use Emma's chat mode to draft product visions:

```bash
# Activate Emma
cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/empathy-mapper.md

# Select chat mode and ask:
"Help me define a product vision for [your product idea]"
```
