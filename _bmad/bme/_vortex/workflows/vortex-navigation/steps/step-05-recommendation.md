# Step 5: Generate Recommendation

Based on the scoring matrix and gap analysis, let's formulate a clear recommendation for your next stream focus.

## Your Task

### Primary Recommendation

**Recommended next stream:** {stream name}

**Rationale:**
- Score: {total from matrix} (highest/near-highest)
- Critical gap addressed: {which gap}
- Risk reduced: {which risk}
- Why now: {urgency or dependency reason}

### Alternative Option

If the primary recommendation isn't feasible:

**Alternative stream:** {stream name}
**When to choose this instead:** {conditions}

### What NOT to Do Next

**Avoid:** {stream name}
**Why:** {rationale -- e.g., "You don't have enough evidence yet" or "This depends on completing X first"}

### Expected Outcomes

If you successfully complete the recommended stream, you should:
1. {outcome 1 -- specific deliverable or learning}
2. {outcome 2}
3. {outcome 3}

### Success Criteria

How will you know the stream was successful?
- [ ] {measurable criterion 1}
- [ ] {measurable criterion 2}
- [ ] {measurable criterion 3}

### Confidence Assessment

**Confidence in this recommendation:** {high / medium / low}
**Key assumption behind recommendation:** {what could make this wrong}
**Re-evaluate if:** {trigger condition to reconsider}

## Your Turn

Review and refine the recommendation. Challenge it: Does this recommendation feel right given everything you've learned? If something feels off, that intuition is worth exploring.
