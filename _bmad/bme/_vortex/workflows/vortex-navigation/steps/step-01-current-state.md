# Step 1: Current State Assessment

Before deciding where to go next, we need to understand where you are now. Let's map your progress across the Vortex streams.

## Your Task

For each of the 7 Vortex streams, assess your current status:

### Stream Status Map

| # | Stream | Status | Key Artifacts | Confidence |
|---|--------|--------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | **Contextualize** | {not-started / in-progress / complete} | {list artifacts} | {low / medium / high} |
| 2 | **Empathize** | {status} | {artifacts} | {confidence} |
| 3 | **Synthesize** | {status} | {artifacts} | {confidence} |
| 4 | **Hypothesize** | {status} | {artifacts} | {confidence} |
| 5 | **Externalize** | {status} | {artifacts} | {confidence} |
| 6 | **Sensitize** | {status} | {artifacts} | {confidence} |
| 7 | **Systematize** | {status} | {artifacts} | {confidence} |

### Status Definitions

- **Not started** - No work done in this stream
- **In progress** - Some work done but not complete
- **Complete** - Core activities finished, artifacts produced

### Confidence Levels

- **Low** - Based on assumptions or limited evidence
- **Medium** - Some evidence supports the work, but gaps remain
- **High** - Strong evidence base, validated through research or experiments

### Context Questions

1. How long has your team been working on this product/problem?
2. What triggered the need to navigate streams right now?
3. Are there external deadlines or constraints affecting your priorities?
4. What is the team's biggest uncertainty right now?

## Your Turn

Please fill in the stream status map and answer the context questions. Be honest about confidence levels -- overestimating progress leads to poor navigation decisions.
