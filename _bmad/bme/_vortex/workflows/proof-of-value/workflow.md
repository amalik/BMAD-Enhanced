# Proof of Value Workflow

**Status:** Coming in v1.2.0

**Agent:** Wade (Lean Experiments Specialist)

**Stream:** Externalize

## Overview

This workflow helps you validate business value before full investment. A proof-of-value answers: "Should we actually build this?"

## What You'll Create

A proof-of-value artifact that captures:
- Value hypothesis being tested
- Target users and their problem
- Validation approach (survey, prototype, pilot)
- Results and user feedback
- Business case assessment (go/no-go)

## Workflow Steps

This workflow will guide you through 6 steps:

1. **State Value Hypothesis** - What value do you believe users will get?
2. **Identify Target Users** - Who would benefit most?
3. **Design Validation** - How will you test value perception?
4. **Run Validation** - Get user feedback
5. **Analyze Results** - Did users perceive value? Would they pay/use it?
6. **Make Decision** - Is there business value? Proceed or pivot?

## Coming Soon

This workflow is currently in development and will be available in BMAD-Enhanced v1.2.0 (planned for March 2026).

### What's Being Built

- Step-by-step guided workflow
- Value testing templates
- User feedback analysis framework
- Business case evaluation tools
- Sample proof-of-values for reference

### Why Wait?

Proof-of-value is the bridge between validated learning and business investment. We're building:
- Clear frameworks for testing value perception
- Integration with lean-experiment and mvp workflows
- Business case templates
- Comprehensive testing and documentation

## Temporary Alternative

While waiting for v1.2.0, you can use Wade's chat mode to plan proof-of-values:

```bash
# Activate Wade
cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/wireframe-designer.md

# Select chat mode and ask:
"Help me design a proof-of-value for [your value hypothesis]"
```
