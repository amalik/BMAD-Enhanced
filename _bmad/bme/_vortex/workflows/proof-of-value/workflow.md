# Proof-of-Value Workflow

Validate that you SHOULD build this (business case) after proving you CAN.

## Steps Overview

1. **Define Value Hypothesis** - What value does this create?
2. **Design Value Test** - How will you validate demand?
3. **Run Market Experiment** - Test with real users/customers
4. **Measure Willingness to Pay** - Will they pay? How much?
5. **Calculate Business Case** - Is this viable?
6. **Document Decision** - Build, pivot, or kill?
