# Step 4: Pains & Gains Revision

With the revised JTBD in place, it's time to update the pains and gains. The experiment evidence changes the landscape — some original pains are confirmed, some are invalidated, and new ones have emerged. The data shows that the pains and gains table is where pivots have their biggest impact.

## Why This Matters

Pains and gains are the operational layer of your problem definition. They're what Liam will use to generate new hypotheses, and what Wade will use to design new experiments. Getting them right — grounded in both original research AND experiment evidence — is the highest-leverage activity in pivot resynthesis.

## Your Task

### 1. Revise Pains

Work through each pain from your original problem definition using this framework:

**Retain:** Pains validated by the experiment (evidence confirms users experience this)
**Remove or deprioritize:** Pains invalidated by experiment evidence (the experiment showed this isn't actually a pain, or it's far less severe than assumed)
**Add:** New pains revealed by the experiment failure (things we didn't know were painful until the experiment failed)
**Update:** Pains whose frequency or intensity changed based on experiment data

| Pain Description | Revision Status | Priority | Frequency | Intensity | Evidence Sources | Current Coping |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| *[Original pain — keep/revise/remove]* | `Retained` / `Revised` / `Removed` / `New` | High/Med/Low | How often | How severely | HC1 artifact + HC4 finding | How users cope |

**For each retained pain:** Note which HC1 artifact originally identified it AND what HC4 evidence confirmed it.

**For each removed pain:** Note which HC4 evidence invalidated it and why.

**For each new pain:** Note which HC4 evidence revealed it and why the original research missed it.

### 2. Revise Gains

Apply the same framework to gains:

**Retain:** Gains still relevant after the experiment
**Reprioritize:** Gains whose importance shifted based on experiment results
**Add:** New gains suggested by the pivot direction or experiment insights
**Remove:** Gains that the experiment showed users don't actually want

| Gain Description | Revision Status | Priority | Expected Impact | Evidence Sources |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| *[Original gain — keep/revise/remove]* | `Retained` / `Revised` / `Reprioritized` / `Removed` / `New` | High/Med/Low | How this changes the user's situation | HC1 artifact + HC4 finding |

### 3. Cross-Reference Against Revised JTBD

Now verify alignment. For each revised pain and gain:
- Does it connect logically to the revised JTBD from Step 3?
- If a pain no longer applies to the job, remove it — even if it was originally High priority
- If a gain doesn't relate to the revised motivation or outcome, reconsider its relevance

Three patterns converge on this insight: the pains and gains that survive both original research AND experiment evidence are your strongest signals. These are the foundation for Liam's next round of hypotheses.

## Your Turn

Walk me through your revised pains and gains tables. For each change, tell me: what changed, what evidence drove the change, and how it connects to the revised JTBD. Based on the experiment evidence, the revised picture should feel sharper and more grounded than the original.
