# Step 3: Option Analysis

Now we rigorously analyze all three options -- Pivot, Patch, and Persevere -- with their pros, cons, risks, and resource implications. This step forces you to seriously consider ALL options before deciding.

## Why This Matters

Teams almost always have a favorite option before analysis begins. This step's purpose is to steelman the options you're NOT leaning toward. Often the best decision is the one that felt uncomfortable at first. By forcing equal rigor across all three options, you protect against both change-aversion ("we've come this far") and shiny-object syndrome ("let's try something new").

## Your Task

### Analyze Each Option

For each of the three options, work through this framework:

---

### Option A: PIVOT

A pivot means changing one or more fundamental elements of your strategy: the problem you're solving, the user you're targeting, the solution approach, or the business model.

**Define the pivot:**
- What specifically would change?
- What would stay the same?
- What new direction would you take?

**Types of pivot to consider:**
| Pivot Type | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Customer segment | Same product, different users | B2C to B2B |
| Problem | Same users, different problem | From "save time" to "reduce risk" |
| Solution | Same problem, different approach | From software to service |
| Channel | Same product, different distribution | From direct sales to marketplace |
| Revenue model | Same product, different monetization | From subscription to usage-based |
| Technology | Same problem, different tech stack | From mobile app to browser extension |
| Platform | From product to platform | From tool to ecosystem |

**Pros of pivoting:**
- What opportunities does this open?
- What problems does this avoid?
- What evidence supports this new direction?

**Cons of pivoting:**
- What do you lose? (Sunk costs, momentum, team expertise, customer relationships)
- What new risks does this introduce?
- How long until you have evidence about the new direction?

**Resource cost:**
- Time to pivot (weeks/months)
- Financial cost
- Team impact (morale, skills gap, hiring needs)
- Customer/partner impact

**Pivot confidence:** On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that the pivot direction would succeed? What evidence supports that confidence?

---

### Option B: PATCH

A patch means adjusting your approach while keeping the core direction. You're changing HOW you execute, not WHAT you're pursuing.

**Define the patch:**
- What specifically would you adjust?
- What stays the same?
- How does this address the evidence that triggered this review?

**Common patch patterns:**
| Pattern | Description | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Narrow focus | Reduce target scope | When it works for a segment but not broadly |
| Add mechanism | Add enablement feature | When adoption needs a catalyst |
| Reposition | Change messaging/framing | When value exists but isn't communicated |
| Sequence change | Change the order of operations | When users struggle with the entry point |
| Remove friction | Simplify the experience | When value is clear but execution is hard |
| Extend timeline | Give it more time | When early signals are positive but immature |

**Pros of patching:**
- What does this preserve from your current progress?
- How does this address the specific issues identified?
- How quickly can you test the patched approach?

**Cons of patching:**
- Is this a genuine improvement or just "lipstick on a pig"?
- Does it address root causes or just symptoms?
- Are you patching because the data says to, or because pivoting feels scary?

**Resource cost:**
- Time to implement and test the patch
- Additional experiments needed
- Opportunity cost of time spent patching vs. pivoting

**Patch confidence:** On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that the patch would resolve the issues? What evidence supports that?

---

### Option C: PERSEVERE

Persevere means staying the course. The evidence supports your direction, and you should invest more resources, run larger experiments, or move to the next stage.

**Define what persevering looks like:**
- What's the next milestone?
- What resources will you commit?
- What's the timeline before the next decision point?

**Pros of persevering:**
- What evidence supports continuing?
- What momentum would you maintain?
- What compounding effects are you building?

**Cons of persevering:**
- Are you persevering because of evidence or because of sunk-cost bias?
- What risks accumulate the longer you stay on this path?
- What opportunities are you forgoing?

**Warning signs you might be persevering for the wrong reasons:**
- "We've already invested so much time/money"
- "The market will come around eventually"
- "We just need more users and it'll work"
- "The data is wrong / users don't know what they want"
- "Our competitors are struggling too, so it's a hard market"

**Persevere confidence:** On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that persevering will lead to success within the next decision timeframe? What evidence supports that?

### Comparative Summary

| Dimension | Pivot | Patch | Persevere |
|-----------|-------|-------|-----------|
| Addresses root cause? | | | |
| Time to next evidence | | | |
| Resource cost | | | |
| Reversibility | | | |
| Confidence (1-10) | | | |
| Biggest risk | | | |

## Example

**Comparative Summary:**

| Dimension | Pivot (to enterprise async platform) | Patch (add champion onboarding, narrow to distributed teams) | Persevere (continue broad remote team approach) |
|-----------|-------|-------|-----------|
| Addresses root cause? | Partially -- avoids adoption problem by selling to IT buyers | Yes -- directly addresses champion dependency and market fit | No -- ignores evidence that co-located teams don't benefit |
| Time to next evidence | 3-4 months (new market research needed) | 4-6 weeks (run patched experiment) | 2-3 months (scale current approach, hope for different results) |
| Resource cost | High (new positioning, possibly new features) | Medium (onboarding flow + refined targeting) | Low (continue current work) |
| Reversibility | Hard to reverse (different market positioning) | Easy to reverse (additive changes) | Easy to reverse (no changes made) |
| Confidence (1-10) | 4 (speculative, no evidence for enterprise market) | 7 (evidence supports both adjustments) | 3 (ignoring contradictory evidence) |
| Biggest risk | Enterprise sales cycle is long; might run out of runway | Patch might not be enough; delays a needed pivot | Throwing good money after bad |

## Your Turn

Please analyze all three options using the frameworks above. Remember: the goal is to steelman each option, not to argue for the one you prefer.

**Key principle:** If you can't articulate strong pros for an option you disagree with, you haven't analyzed it well enough.
