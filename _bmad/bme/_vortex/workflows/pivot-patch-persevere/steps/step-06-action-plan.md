# Step 6: Action Plan

Now we translate the decision into a concrete action plan. What happens next, who does it, and how will you know it's working?

## Why This Matters

Decisions without action plans are just opinions. The gap between "we decided to patch" and "here's what happens Monday morning" is where most strategic decisions die. This step closes that gap with specifics.

## Your Task

### 1. Immediate Actions (This Week)

What must happen RIGHT NOW to begin executing the decision?

For each action:
- **What:** Specific deliverable or task
- **Who:** Named owner
- **By when:** Specific date
- **Done when:** How do you know this is complete?

**Common immediate actions by decision type:**

For PIVOT:
- Communicate the pivot to the team with rationale
- Pause current work that doesn't align with new direction
- Identify what existing work carries over vs. what's abandoned
- Begin discovery research for the new direction

For PATCH:
- Define the specific adjustments to make
- Update target persona/market definitions
- Design the patched experiment
- Communicate scope changes to stakeholders

For PERSEVERE:
- Define the next milestone and success criteria
- Allocate additional resources to current direction
- Scale up experiments from pilot to broader testing
- Set the next decision checkpoint date

### 2. Next Experiment Design

Your decision should lead directly to the next experiment. Design it now:

**Experiment name:** {name}
**Hypothesis:** We believe that [adjustment/new direction] will result in [measurable outcome] because [rationale from the decision].
**Method:** {specific approach}
**Sample size:** {target}
**Duration:** {timeline}
**Success criteria:** {pre-defined thresholds}

**How this experiment tests the decision:**
- If the experiment succeeds, it means: {the decision was right because...}
- If the experiment fails, it means: {we need to reconsider because...}

### 3. Communication Plan

Who needs to know about this decision and when?

| Audience | Message | Channel | When | Who Delivers |
|----------|---------|---------|------|-------------|
| Core team | Full rationale + action plan | Team meeting | {date} | {name} |
| Stakeholders | Decision summary + implications | Email/document | {date} | {name} |
| Customers/users | {if relevant} | {channel} | {date} | {name} |
| Board/investors | {if relevant} | {format} | {date} | {name} |

### 4. Resource Allocation

What resources does this action plan require?

**People:**
- Who needs to shift focus?
- Any new skills or hiring needed?
- Who is freed up from deprioritized work?

**Time:**
- What's the timeline to first meaningful result?
- What's the next decision checkpoint?
- What deadlines or dependencies exist?

**Budget:**
- Direct costs (tools, ads, recruitment, etc.)
- Opportunity cost of what you're NOT doing

### 5. Success Metrics and Checkpoints

Define how you'll track progress:

**Leading indicators (check weekly):**
These are early signals that the action plan is on track:
- {metric 1: what you're measuring and target}
- {metric 2: what you're measuring and target}

**Lagging indicators (check at milestones):**
These are the outcomes that prove the decision was right:
- {metric 1: what you're measuring and target}
- {metric 2: what you're measuring and target}

**Checkpoint schedule:**

| Date | What We Review | Decision to Make |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| {date} | Leading indicators from first week | Are we executing well? |
| {date} | Mid-experiment data | Any early signals (positive or negative)? |
| {date} | Full experiment results | Did the patch/pivot/persevere work? |
| {date} | Strategic reassessment | Next PPP decision if needed |

### 6. Risk Mitigation

For each major risk identified in Step 5, define a mitigation:

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------|--------|------------|-------|
| {risk 1} | {H/M/L} | {H/M/L} | {specific action} | {name} |
| {risk 2} | {H/M/L} | {H/M/L} | {specific action} | {name} |

## Example

**Immediate Actions:**

| What | Who | By When | Done When |
|------|-----|---------|-----------|
| Update target persona to "distributed teams, 3+ timezones" | Alex | Monday | New persona doc shared with team |
| Design champion onboarding flow (wireframes) | Dana | Wednesday | Flow documented with 5 onboarding steps |
| Recruit 8-10 distributed teams for 4-week study | Sam | Friday next week | 8+ teams confirmed and scheduled |
| Set up tracking dashboard for new experiment | Jordan | Thursday | Dashboard live with all metrics defined |

**Next Experiment:**

**Name:** Champion-Enabled Async Adoption Study v2
**Hypothesis:** We believe that distributed teams (3+ timezones) will sustain 75%+ daily async video update participation over 4 weeks when onboarded with a designated team champion, because our pilot showed 91% adoption in champion-led distributed team vs. 62% without.
**Method:** 4-week study with 8-10 teams, all with designated champions who complete a 30-minute onboarding session
**Success criteria:**
- 75%+ daily participation rate at Week 4 (not just Week 1)
- Week 4 participation within 10% of Week 1 (proves sustainability)
- Team alignment score 4.0+ on 5-point scale
- At least 7 of 10 teams meet individual thresholds

**Checkpoint Schedule:**

| Date | Review | Decision |
|------|--------|----------|
| Week 1 end | Participation rates, champion engagement | Any teams need support? |
| Week 2 end | Drop-off trends, qualitative feedback | Is novelty wearing off? Patterns emerging? |
| Week 3 end | Sustainability signal, alignment scores | Early read: is this working? |
| Week 4 end | Full results against success criteria | Next PPP decision |

## Your Turn

Please create your action plan using the structure above. Make every action specific enough that someone could execute it without asking for clarification.

**Key principle:** "We'll figure it out as we go" is not a plan. The specificity of your action plan is a direct measure of your decision's seriousness.

## Workflow Complete

After creating the action plan, your PPP decision artifact will include:
- Complete evidence inventory and analysis
- Hypothesis health assessment
- Rigorous option analysis (all three options seriously considered)
- Stakeholder perspectives and dissenting views
- Clear decision with rationale and reversal criteria
- Concrete action plan with owners, timelines, and success metrics
- Risk mitigation strategies

## Vortex Compass

Based on what you just completed, here are your evidence-driven options:

| If you learned... | Consider next... | Agent | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pivoting — new direction | contextualize-scope | Emma 🎯 | Re-contextualize for the pivot |
| Patching — adjust approach | lean-experiment | Wade 🧪 | Test the adjusted approach |
| Persevering — need deeper insight | user-discovery | Isla 🔍 | Strengthen your understanding of users |
