# Lean Experiment Workflow

**Status:** Coming in v1.2.0

**Agent:** Wade (Lean Experiments Specialist)

**Stream:** Externalize

## Overview

This workflow guides you through a complete Build-Measure-Learn cycle to validate a specific hypothesis about your product or users.

## What You'll Create

A lean experiment artifact that captures:
- Hypothesis being tested
- Experiment design (what you'll build/test)
- Success criteria and metrics
- Results and observations
- Learnings and next actions (pivot or persevere)

## Workflow Steps

This workflow will guide you through 6 steps:

1. **State Hypothesis** - What do you believe to be true?
2. **Design Experiment** - What's the smallest test of that belief?
3. **Define Success** - What results would validate/invalidate the hypothesis?
4. **Run Experiment** - Execute the test
5. **Measure Results** - What did you observe?
6. **Extract Learnings** - What did you learn? Pivot or persevere?

## Coming Soon

This workflow is currently in development and will be available in BMAD-Enhanced v1.2.0 (planned for March 2026).

### What's Being Built

- Step-by-step guided workflow
- Experiment canvas template
- Result analysis framework
- Pivot/persevere decision guide
- Sample experiments for reference

### Why Wait?

Lean experimentation is the core of Wade's new positioning. We're building:
- Hypothesis testing frameworks
- Measurement and analysis tools
- Integration with mvp, proof-of-concept, and proof-of-value workflows
- Comprehensive testing and documentation

## Temporary Alternative

While waiting for v1.2.0, you can use Wade's chat mode to design experiments:

```bash
# Activate Wade
cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/wireframe-designer.md

# Select chat mode and ask:
"Help me design a lean experiment to test [your hypothesis]"
```
