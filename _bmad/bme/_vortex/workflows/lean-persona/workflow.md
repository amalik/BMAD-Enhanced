# Lean Persona Workflow

**Status:** Coming in v1.2.0

**Agent:** Emma (Contextualization Expert)

**Stream:** Contextualize

## Overview

This workflow helps you create lean user personas that focus on jobs-to-be-done and problem contexts rather than demographics. Unlike traditional personas, lean personas are hypothesis-driven and validation-focused.

## What You'll Create

A lean persona artifact that captures:
- User's job-to-be-done
- Current solution and pain points
- Desired outcomes and success metrics
- Key assumptions to validate
- Validation plan

## Workflow Steps

This workflow will guide you through 5 steps:

1. **Define Job-to-be-Done** - What is the user trying to accomplish?
2. **Current State Analysis** - How do they solve this today?
3. **Desired Outcomes** - What would success look like?
4. **Assumption Mapping** - What are we assuming about this user?
5. **Validation Planning** - How will we test our assumptions?

## Coming Soon

This workflow is currently in development and will be available in BMAD-Enhanced v1.2.0 (planned for March 2026).

### What's Being Built

- Step-by-step guided workflow
- Interactive prompts for each section
- Validation templates
- Integration with Wade's lean-experiment workflow
- Sample lean personas for reference

### Why Wait?

We're repositioning Emma from empathy mapping to strategic contextualization. This requires:
- New step files aligned with Lean Startup principles
- Templates focused on jobs-to-be-done
- Validation framework integration
- Testing and documentation

## Temporary Alternative

While waiting for v1.2.0, you can use Emma's chat mode to create lean personas:

```bash
# Activate Emma
cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/empathy-mapper.md

# Select chat mode and ask:
"Help me create a lean persona for [your user type] who is trying to [job-to-be-done]"
```
