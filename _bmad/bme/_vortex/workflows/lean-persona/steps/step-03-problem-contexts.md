# Step 3: Problem Contexts

Understanding WHEN, WHERE, and WHY the problem occurs helps us design solutions that fit the real context of use.

## Why This Matters

Context shapes behavior. A solution that works at a desk doesn't work on mobile. A solution that works when calm doesn't work when stressed. Understanding context helps us:
- Design for the real moment of use
- Identify hidden constraints
- Find the triggers that make the problem urgent
- Avoid solutions that look good in demos but fail in reality

## Your Task

Answer these questions about the problem context:

### 1. When does this problem occur?
- Time of day? Day of week?
- Start of month? End of quarter?
- During specific events or milestones?
- Is it predictable or unpredictable?

### 2. Where does this problem occur?
- Physical location (office, home, commute, coffee shop)?
- Digital location (which tools/platforms)?
- State of mind (focused work, multitasking, distracted)?

### 3. Why does this problem matter NOW?
What's changed recently that makes this problem more urgent?
- New pressures? New competitors?
- Changing expectations? Regulatory changes?
- Or has it always been urgent but unaddressed?

### 4. What triggers the need?
What specific event makes the user think "I need to solve this NOW"?

### 5. What's happening around them?
What else are they juggling when this problem hits?
Other tasks? Interruptions? Deadlines?

## Example

**When:**
- Every Monday morning (weekly planning)
- Throughout the week when someone asks "What's the status on X?"
- Friday afternoon (preparing for Monday's meeting)
- URGENCY SPIKES: When a deadline is at risk and manager doesn't realize until it's too late

**Where:**
- Physical: Home office (80%), coffee shop/coworking (20%)
- Digital: Bouncing between Slack, Google Docs, Linear, Figma, GitHub
- State of mind: Usually multitasking - checking status while on calls, while reviewing work, while coding

**Why NOW:**
- Company grew from 10 to 50 people - old informal methods don't scale
- Remote-first means can't just "walk over and ask"
- Increased customer commitments mean missed deadlines = angry customers
- CEO now asks weekly "Are we on track?" and manager doesn't have confident answer

**Triggers:**
- Monday morning: "What should we focus on this week?"
- Mid-week: Slack DM asking "When will X be done?"
- Client escalation: "Where's the feature you promised?"
- Team member stuck: "I'm blocked, what should I work on instead?"

**Context:**
- Usually happens during already-busy times
- Interrupts deep work to gather status
- Manager feels reactive, not proactive
- Team feels over-managed and interrupted

## Your Turn

Please describe the problem contexts using the structure above.

**Tip:** Context shapes constraints. A solution that requires focused attention won't work if the user is constantly interrupted. Design for the REAL context, not the ideal context.
