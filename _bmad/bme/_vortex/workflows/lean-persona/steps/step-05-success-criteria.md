# Step 5: Success Criteria

What does a successful solution look like? How will the user know it's working? What are they willing to trade off?

## Why This Matters

Success criteria help us:
- Define measurable outcomes (not just features)
- Avoid building the wrong thing
- Know when we've solved the problem (or when to pivot)
- Understand acceptable trade-offs

Without clear success criteria, we risk building something users think is "nice" but never actually use.

## Your Task

Answer these questions about success criteria:

### 1. What's the desired outcome?
If this solution worked perfectly, what would change in the user's life/work?

Be specific and measurable. Not "less stressed" but "can answer 'Are we on track?' in <30 seconds with confidence."

### 2. What success metrics matter?
How will they measure success?

- Time saved?
- Money saved?
- Quality improved?
- Stress reduced?
- Confidence increased?

Define the metric AND the target threshold.

### 3. How quickly do they need to see value?
- Immediate (first use)?
- Within a week?
- Within a month?
- Within a quarter?

What's the acceptable "time to value"?

### 4. What trade-offs are acceptable?
What are they willing to sacrifice for the desired outcome?

- Pay more for time saved?
- Accept some complexity for power?
- Sacrifice some features for simplicity?
- Change workflows for better results?

### 5. What trade-offs are NOT acceptable?
What are the deal-breakers?

## Example

**Desired Outcome:**
"I can confidently answer 'Are we on track?' in less than 30 seconds, and proactively spot problems before they become crises."

**Success Metrics:**
1. **Time to status check:** <30 seconds (vs. current 15+ minutes)
2. **Proactive problem detection:** Catch blockers within 24 hours (vs. current 3-5 days)
3. **Team interruptions:** <2 per day (vs. current 10+)
4. **Manager confidence:** Can give accurate status updates without hunting for information
5. **Wasted time:** <1 hour/week on status (vs. current 5 hours)

**Time to Value:**
- **Week 1:** Must be easier than current solution or team won't adopt
- **Week 2:** Should reduce daily interruptions noticeably
- **Month 1:** Should save 2+ hours/week measurably
- **Month 3:** Should prevent at least one "missed deadline surprise"

**Acceptable Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Pay $10-30/person/month for 4+ hours saved weekly
- ✅ Spend 2 hours learning the tool to save 5+ hours/week ongoing
- ✅ Change Monday meeting format (shorter, more focused)
- ✅ Require team to update status (if it's < 5 min/day)

**NOT Acceptable Trade-offs:**
- ❌ Add MORE overhead (e.g., 15 min/day to update)
- ❌ Replace one complicated tool with another complicated tool
- ❌ Require team to learn completely new workflow
- ❌ Lose historical information/context
- ❌ Create visibility for manager but burden for team

## Your Turn

Please define success criteria using the structure above.

**Tip:** If you can't define measurable success criteria, you can't validate whether your solution works. "Better" and "easier" aren't measurable. "Reduces time from 15 min to 2 min" is measurable.
