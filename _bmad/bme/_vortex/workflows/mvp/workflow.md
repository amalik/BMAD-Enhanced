# MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Workflow

**Status:** Coming in v1.2.0

**Agent:** Wade (Lean Experiments Specialist)

**Stream:** Externalize

## Overview

This workflow helps you design a Minimum Viable Product that tests your riskiest assumptions with the minimum amount of effort.

## What You'll Create

An MVP specification artifact that captures:
- Core value proposition being tested
- Riskiest assumptions to validate
- MVP feature set (what's in, what's out)
- Success metrics and validation criteria
- Build plan and timeline

## Workflow Steps

This workflow will guide you through 6 steps:

1. **Define Value Proposition** - What core value are you testing?
2. **Identify Risky Assumptions** - What must be true for this to work?
3. **Design MVP Scope** - What's the minimum to test those assumptions?
4. **Define Success Metrics** - How will you know if it worked?
5. **Plan Build** - What's the fastest path to testing?
6. **Document Learnings** - What did you expect to learn?

## Coming Soon

This workflow is currently in development and will be available in BMAD-Enhanced v1.2.0 (planned for March 2026).

### What's Being Built

- Step-by-step guided workflow
- MVP canvas template
- Feature prioritization framework
- Integration with lean-experiment workflow
- Sample MVPs for reference

### Why Wait?

We're repositioning Wade from wireframe design to lean experimentation. This requires:
- New step files aligned with Build-Measure-Learn principles
- Templates focused on assumption testing
- Integration with proof-of-concept and proof-of-value workflows
- Testing and documentation

## Temporary Alternative

While waiting for v1.2.0, you can use Wade's chat mode to design MVPs:

```bash
# Activate Wade
cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/wireframe-designer.md

# Select chat mode and ask:
"Help me design an MVP to test [your riskiest assumption]"
```
