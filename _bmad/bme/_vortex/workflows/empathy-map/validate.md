# Validate Existing Empathy Map

Bring me an empathy map and I'll help you validate it against user research evidence.

## Why Validation Matters

Empathy maps lose value if they're based on assumptions instead of research. Validation ensures:
- Every insight traces back to evidence
- No speculation or "we think users want..."
- Team stays grounded in user reality

## Validation Process

### 1. Evidence Check

For each insight in the empathy map, ask:

**Can you point to research that supports this?**
- Direct quote from interview?
- Observed behavior?
- Survey data?
- Analytics?

**Red Flags:**
- "We think users want..."
- "Users probably feel..."
- "Based on our internal discussions..."
- No citation to research source

### 2. Specificity Check

**Is the target user specific enough?**
- ❌ "Mobile users"
- ❌ "Marketing professionals"
- ✅ "Marketing managers at mid-sized B2B companies managing lead generation"

**Are pain points concrete?**
- ❌ "Bad UX"
- ✅ "Campaign creation button hidden in nested menu (3 clicks deep)"

**Are gains measurable?**
- ❌ "Want to be more efficient"
- ✅ "Complete campaign setup in under 10 minutes vs. current 45 minutes"

### 3. Completeness Check

**Did you explore all dimensions?**
- [ ] Says (direct quotes)
- [ ] Thinks (inferred thoughts)
- [ ] Does (observable actions)
- [ ] Feels (emotional states)
- [ ] Pains (obstacles/frustrations)
- [ ] Gains (desired outcomes)

**Did you capture both positive and negative?**
- Not just problems (pain points)
- Also aspirations (gains)
- Moments of delight AND frustration

### 4. Actionability Check

**Can designers use this?**
- Are pain points specific enough to inform design decisions?
- Are gains clear enough to prioritize features?

**Can product managers use this?**
- Can they defend feature decisions with user insights?
- Can they communicate user needs to stakeholders?

## Your Turn

**Please share:**
1. The empathy map you want to validate (paste content or provide file path)
2. The research sources that informed it

I'll review it and provide:
- **Evidence gaps** - Insights lacking research support
- **Specificity issues** - Vague statements that need clarification
- **Missing dimensions** - Areas you didn't explore
- **Validation score** - Overall assessment (Strong / Needs Work / Speculative)

---

## Validation Criteria

**Strong Empathy Map:**
- ✅ Every insight backed by cited research
- ✅ Specific target user definition
- ✅ Concrete, measurable pain points and gains
- ✅ All 6 dimensions explored (Says, Thinks, Does, Feels, Pains, Gains)
- ✅ Both positive and negative aspects captured
- ✅ Actionable for designers and product managers

**Needs Work:**
- ⚠️ Some insights lack research support
- ⚠️ Target user could be more specific
- ⚠️ Pain points or gains are vague
- ⚠️ Missing some dimensions

**Speculative:**
- ❌ Many insights are assumptions
- ❌ No clear research sources
- ❌ "We think" instead of "Users said"
- ❌ Not actionable
