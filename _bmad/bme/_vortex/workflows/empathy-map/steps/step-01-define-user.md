# Step 1: Define Target User

Before we create an empathy map, we need to be crystal clear about WHO we're creating it for.

## Why This Matters

An empathy map is only as useful as its specificity. "Users" is too broad. "Mobile app users" is still too broad. "Busy parents managing multiple kids' schedules on mobile" - now we're getting somewhere.

## Your Task

Answer these questions to define your target user:

### 1. Who is this user? (Demographics)
- Age range?
- Occupation/role?
- Location/context?
- Tech savvy level?

### 2. What is their core job-to-be-done?
What are they trying to accomplish when they interact with your product/service?

### 3. What context are we focusing on?
When and where are they using your product? What's happening around them?

### 4. What user research informs this empathy map?
- Interview transcripts?
- Survey responses?
- Observational studies?
- Analytics data?

## Example

**Target User:** Sarah, a 34-year-old marketing manager at a mid-sized B2B SaaS company. She manages a team of 5 and is responsible for lead generation campaigns.

**Job-to-be-done:** Plan and execute multi-channel marketing campaigns that generate qualified leads for the sales team.

**Context:** Working from home office, juggling multiple campaigns simultaneously, under pressure to hit quarterly lead targets.

**Research Sources:**
- 3 user interviews (transcripts: INT-001, INT-002, INT-003)
- Survey of 50 marketing managers
- 2 hours of screen-recording observation
