# Step 6: Synthesize

Time to bring it all together and create the final empathy map artifact.

## Why This Matters

We've gathered rich insights across 5 dimensions (Says, Thinks, Does, Feels, Pains, Gains). Now we need to synthesize them into a coherent, actionable empathy map that:
- Tells a compelling story about the user
- Reveals patterns and insights
- Guides design and product decisions

## Your Task

### 1. Review All Insights

Look across all the data you've captured:
- Target user definition (Step 1)
- Says & Thinks (Step 2)
- Does & Feels (Step 3)
- Pain Points (Step 4)
- Gains (Step 5)

### 2. Identify Key Insights

What patterns emerge? What surprises you? What's most important?

**Example Insights:**
- "Sarah says she wants more features, but really needs simplification - her current process involves 6 tools"
- "Biggest pain isn't the tool itself, it's the data silos preventing real-time decisions"
- "Anxiety about missing notifications drives obsessive email checking - automation would reduce stress"

### 3. Create the Empathy Map

I'll use the template at `empathy-map.template.md` to generate your final artifact.

**Output File:** `{output_folder}/empathy-map-{user-name}-{date}.md`

### 4. Validation Questions

Before we finalize, let's validate:

**Evidence Check:**
- [ ] Is every insight backed by research (quotes, observations, data)?
- [ ] Did we avoid speculation and assumptions?
- [ ] Can we trace each insight back to a specific source?

**Specificity Check:**
- [ ] Is the target user definition specific enough?
- [ ] Are pain points concrete and actionable?
- [ ] Are gains measurable?

**Actionability Check:**
- [ ] Can designers use this to inform wireframes?
- [ ] Can product managers use this to prioritize features?
- [ ] Can developers use this to understand user context?

**Completeness Check:**
- [ ] Did we capture both positive and negative aspects?
- [ ] Did we explore emotions, not just behaviors?
- [ ] Did we understand the WHY, not just the WHAT?

## Your Turn

Please review all your insights and identify 3-5 key patterns or surprises that emerged.

Then confirm you're ready for me to generate the final empathy map artifact.

## Output

Once you confirm, I'll create:

**File:** `{output_folder}/empathy-map-{user-name}-{date}.md`

**Contents:**
- Executive Summary (key insights)
- Target User Profile
- Says & Thinks
- Does & Feels
- Pain Points (prioritized)
- Desired Gains (prioritized)
- Design Implications
- Research Sources

## Vortex Compass

Based on what you just completed, here are your evidence-driven options:

| If you learned... | Consider next... | Agent | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pain points need validation | lean-experiment | Wade 🧪 | Test if pain points drive real behavior |
| New user segment discovered | lean-persona | Emma 🎯 | Re-contextualize for the new segment |
| Deeper understanding needed | user-interview | Isla 🔍 | Follow up with targeted interviews |
