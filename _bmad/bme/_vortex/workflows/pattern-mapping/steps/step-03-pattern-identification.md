# Step 3: Pattern Identification

Now that we understand what each artifact individually reveals, it's time to look across all artifacts together and identify the patterns that no single artifact shows alone.

## Why This Matters

Cross-source triangulation is where the real insights emerge. One data point is an anecdote, three are a pattern. When the same theme, behavior, or pain appears across multiple independent research streams, that's a signal worth paying attention to. This step systematically maps those cross-artifact patterns.

## Your Task

### 1. Cross-Artifact Pattern Identification

Look across all your artifacts and identify:

**Recurring Themes** — What topics or concerns appear in multiple artifacts?
- Example: "Both the empathy map and interview synthesis mention time pressure as a recurring theme"

**Convergent Behaviors** — What user behaviors show up repeatedly?
- Example: "Three separate artifacts reference users creating workarounds for the same limitation"

**Contradictions** — Where do artifacts disagree or present conflicting evidence?
- Example: "Empathy map suggests users want more features, but interviews reveal they feel overwhelmed by current complexity"

**Evidence Gaps** — What questions remain unanswered across all artifacts?
- Example: "We have strong evidence about pain points but almost no data on what users would consider a successful outcome"

### 2. Pattern Strength Assessment

For each pattern you identify, assess its strength:

| Strength | Criteria | Implication |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Universal** | Appears in all artifacts with consistent evidence | Strong signal — likely a real pattern |
| **Multi-source** | Appears in 2+ artifacts | Pattern emerging — worth investigating |
| **Single** | Appears in only 1 artifact | Anecdote — needs more evidence before acting on it |

### 3. Build Your Pattern Inventory

Capture each pattern in this format:

| Pattern | Source Artifacts | Strength | Type | Evidence Count |
|---------|-----------------|----------|------|---------------|
| *Name the pattern* | *Which artifacts* | *Universal / Multi-source / Single* | *Theme / Behavior / Contradiction / Gap* | *Number of data points* |

**Pattern types:**
- **Theme** — A recurring topic or concern (e.g., "time pressure")
- **Behavior** — A repeated user action or coping mechanism (e.g., "building personal workarounds")
- **Contradiction** — Conflicting evidence between artifacts (e.g., "want more features vs. overwhelmed by complexity")
- **Gap** — Missing evidence or unanswered questions (e.g., "no data on success criteria")

## Example Pattern Inventory

**From 3 artifacts** (empathy map, interview synthesis, observation report):

| Pattern | Source Artifacts | Strength | Type | Evidence Count |
|---------|-----------------|----------|------|---------------|
| Morning routine is highest-stress period | Empathy map, Interviews, Observations | Universal | Theme | 18 data points across all 3 |
| Users build personal workarounds (spreadsheets, sticky notes) | Interviews, Observations | Multi-source | Behavior | 8 instances across 2 artifacts |
| Want more features vs. overwhelmed by complexity | Empathy map vs. Interviews | Multi-source | Contradiction | 5 + 6 data points in opposition |
| No data on what "success" looks like to users | All 3 (by absence) | Universal | Gap | 0 — completely absent |

Here's what the research is telling us: the first pattern (morning stress) has the strongest evidence — 18 data points across all three artifacts. That's not an anecdote; that's a clear signal. The contradiction (features vs. complexity) is also critical — it may reveal a deeper pattern about users who want capability without cognitive load.

## Your Turn

Build your pattern inventory. What patterns emerge when you lay your artifacts side by side? Across these artifacts, the evidence clusters around — share what you're finding.
