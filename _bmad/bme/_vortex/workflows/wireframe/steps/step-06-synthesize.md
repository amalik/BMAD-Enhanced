# Step 6: Synthesize

Time to bring it all together and create the final wireframe artifact!

## Why This Matters

We've gathered requirements, mapped user flows, designed information architecture, sketched wireframes, and specified components. Now we synthesize everything into a professional wireframe document that designers and developers can use.

## What I'll Create

Using the template at `wireframe.template.md`, I'll generate your complete wireframe artifact with:

1. **Executive Summary** - Key design decisions at a glance
2. **Requirements** - What we're solving for
3. **User Flows** - How users navigate
4. **Information Architecture** - Content organization
5. **Wireframe Sketches** - ASCII art layouts
6. **Component Specifications** - Detailed component specs
7. **Interaction Design** - Behaviors and states
8. **Responsive Breakpoints** - Adaptive layouts
9. **Accessibility Notes** - WCAG compliance
10. **Design Rationale** - Why these decisions?
11. **Next Steps** - Handoff to high-fidelity design

## Output Location

**File:** `{output_folder}/wireframe-{screen-name}-{date}.md`

Example: `wireframe-dashboard-home-2026-02-15.md`

## Before I Generate

Let me review all the information we've gathered:

### Requirements Checklist
- [ ] Screen name and platform defined
- [ ] Target user identified
- [ ] Primary action clear
- [ ] Constraints documented

### Flow Checklist
- [ ] Entry points mapped
- [ ] Happy path defined
- [ ] Alternative flows considered
- [ ] Exit points clear

### Architecture Checklist
- [ ] Visual hierarchy established
- [ ] Content grouped logically
- [ ] Navigation patterns defined

### Wireframe Checklist
- [ ] ASCII sketch created
- [ ] Grid system followed
- [ ] Component placements clear

### Components Checklist
- [ ] All components identified
- [ ] Interactions specified
- [ ] States documented
- [ ] Responsive behavior defined

## Your Turn

Please confirm you're ready for me to generate the final wireframe artifact, or let me know if we need to revise any section.

## What's Next After This?

Once I create your wireframe artifact, you can:

1. **Validate with users** - Show the wireframe to users and get feedback
2. **Share with team** - Get stakeholder alignment on structure
3. **Create high-fidelity designs** - Use this as foundation for visual design
4. **Prototype** - Build interactive prototype from wireframe
5. **Develop** - Hand off to developers with clear specifications

Great work! This wireframe will be a solid foundation for your design and development. 🎨
