# Contextualize Scope Workflow

**Status:** Coming in v1.2.0

**Agent:** Emma (Contextualization Expert)

**Stream:** Contextualize

## Overview

This workflow helps you decide which problem space to investigate by evaluating multiple opportunities and selecting the most promising one to pursue.

## What You'll Create

A scope decision artifact that captures:
- Problem opportunities identified
- Evaluation criteria (impact, feasibility, strategic fit)
- Scoring matrix for each opportunity
- Selected problem space with rationale
- De-scoped opportunities (and why)

## Workflow Steps

This workflow will guide you through 5 steps:

1. **List Opportunities** - What problems could you solve?
2. **Define Criteria** - How will you evaluate opportunities?
3. **Score Opportunities** - Rate each against your criteria
4. **Make Decision** - Which problem space will you investigate?
5. **Document Rationale** - Why this one? Why not the others?

## Coming Soon

This workflow is currently in development and will be available in BMAD-Enhanced v1.2.0 (planned for March 2026).

### What's Being Built

- Step-by-step guided workflow
- Opportunity scoring templates
- Decision framework (ICE, RICE, or custom)
- Integration with product-vision workflow
- Sample scope decisions for reference

### Why Wait?

Strategic scoping is a critical decision point that bridges contextualization (Emma) and externalization (Wade). We're ensuring this workflow:
- Uses proven decision frameworks
- Captures rationale for future reference
- Sets up clean handoff to Wade's experiment workflows

## Temporary Alternative

While waiting for v1.2.0, you can use Emma's chat mode to explore scope decisions:

```bash
# Activate Emma
cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/contextualization-expert.md

# Select chat mode and ask:
"Help me decide which problem space to investigate: [list your options]"
```
