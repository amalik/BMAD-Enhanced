# Step 4: Define Scope Boundaries

What's IN scope? What's OUT?

## Your Task

Define clear boundaries:

### What's IN Scope
- Which user segment?
- Which use cases?
- Which geography/market?

### What's OUT of Scope
- What are you explicitly NOT solving?
- What's phase 2 or phase 3?

## Your Turn

Define your scope boundaries.
