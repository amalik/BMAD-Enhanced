# Step 6: Synthesize

Create the final scope decision document.

## Your Task

Provide final decision summary:

1. **Selected scope** and why
2. **De-scoped opportunities** and why not now
3. **Next steps** (suggested: lean-persona → mvp → lean-experiment)

Based on what you just completed, here are your evidence-driven options:

| If you learned... | Consider next... | Agent | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scope is defined, users unknown | lean-persona | Emma 🎯 | Understand who exists in this problem space |
| Scope chosen, need user validation | user-interview | Isla 🔍 | Confirm real users care about this scope |
| Ready to test assumptions | mvp | Wade 🧪 | Design the smallest test for your scope decision |
