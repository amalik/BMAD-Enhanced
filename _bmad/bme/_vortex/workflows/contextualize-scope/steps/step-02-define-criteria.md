# Step 2: Define Evaluation Criteria

How will you decide which problem to pursue?

## Your Task

Define 3-5 criteria for evaluating opportunities. Common criteria:

- **Impact:** How many people does this affect? How painful is it?
- **Feasibility:** Can we actually build this? Do we have the expertise?
- **Strategic Fit:** Does this align with our vision and strengths?
- **Market Opportunity:** Size of market? Willingness to pay?
- **Time to Value:** How quickly can we validate this?

## Example

1. **Impact** (Weight: 30%) - Number of users × problem intensity
2. **Feasibility** (Weight: 25%) - Team expertise + technical complexity
3. **Strategic Fit** (Weight: 25%) - Alignment with long-term vision
4. **Speed to Validation** (Weight: 20%) - Can we test this in <3 months?
