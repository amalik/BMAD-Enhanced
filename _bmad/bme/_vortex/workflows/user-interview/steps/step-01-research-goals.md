# Step 1: Define Research Goals

Before writing a single interview question, you need clarity on what you want to learn and why it matters to your product decisions.

## Why This Matters

Research without clear goals produces interesting stories but no actionable insights. Well-defined goals help you:
- Stay focused during interviews instead of wandering
- Know when you've learned enough to act
- Prioritize which questions matter most
- Connect findings directly to product decisions
- Avoid "research theater" -- doing interviews to feel productive without learning anything useful

## Your Task

Answer these questions to define your research goals:

### 1. What is the primary research question?

State the single most important thing you need to learn. Be specific.

**Weak:** "What do users think about our product?"
**Strong:** "Why do users who sign up for a free trial abandon it within the first 3 days?"

**Weak:** "How do people manage their finances?"
**Strong:** "What triggers freelancers to look for invoicing software, and what do they try before finding a paid tool?"

### 2. What decisions will this research inform?

Research must connect to decisions. Otherwise it sits in a document no one reads.

Examples:
- "Should we invest in onboarding improvements or new features?"
- "Which of our three persona hypotheses is closest to reality?"
- "Is this problem painful enough that users would pay to solve it?"

### 3. What do you already know (or believe)?

List your existing assumptions. Be honest about what is validated versus what is a guess.

**Format:**
- VALIDATED: {insight} -- Source: {how you know this}
- ASSUMPTION: {belief} -- Confidence: High/Medium/Low
- UNKNOWN: {question you cannot answer today}

### 4. What would change your mind?

Define what a surprising or contradictory finding would look like. This prevents confirmation bias.

Example: "If fewer than 2 out of 8 participants mention onboarding as a pain point, we should deprioritize the onboarding redesign."

### 5. How many interviews do you plan to conduct?

General guidance:
- **5-8 interviews** for exploratory discovery (finding new problems)
- **8-12 interviews** for validating a specific hypothesis
- **3-5 interviews** for usability or task-based feedback
- You will typically see patterns emerge after 5-6 interviews on the same topic

## Example

**Primary Research Question:**
Why do small business owners (1-10 employees) continue using spreadsheets for project tracking even after evaluating dedicated project management tools?

**Decisions This Informs:**
- Whether to position our tool as a "spreadsheet replacement" or a "spreadsheet complement"
- Which 3 features to prioritize in Q2 to reduce switching friction
- Whether our pricing is a barrier or if the issue is something else entirely

**What We Know:**
- VALIDATED: 62% of trial users import data from spreadsheets -- Source: onboarding analytics
- ASSUMPTION: Users find PM tools "too complex" for small teams -- Confidence: Medium
- ASSUMPTION: Price is a secondary concern; learning curve is primary -- Confidence: Low
- UNKNOWN: What specific spreadsheet workflows are they reluctant to give up?

**What Would Change Our Mind:**
- If most participants say price is the primary blocker, we need to rethink our freemium strategy
- If participants are happy with spreadsheets and don't feel pain, this market may not be viable

**Planned Interviews:** 8 (small business owners who evaluated but did not adopt a PM tool)

## Your Turn

Please define your research goals using the structure above.

**Tip:** If you cannot clearly state what decision this research will inform, you are not ready to interview. Spend more time on goal definition first.
