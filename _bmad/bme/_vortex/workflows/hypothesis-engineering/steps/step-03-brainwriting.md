# Step 3: Structured Brainwriting & Hypothesis Drafting

Time to engineer hypotheses. Not brainstorm. Not wish. Engineer — with structure, precision, and the courage to make falsifiable bets.

## Why This Matters

4-field hypothesis contracts force clarity: belief, evidence needed, experiment, success criteria. Without this structure, teams produce vague aspirations disguised as hypotheses — "We think users will like it" is not a hypothesis. A real hypothesis specifies exactly what outcome you expect, what behavior will change, why you believe it, and the single assumption that could destroy the entire idea. That's the craft of hypothesis engineering.

## Your Task

### 1. Structured Brainwriting

For each hypothesis target identified in Step 2, we'll use structured brainwriting to generate candidate hypotheses. This is NOT unstructured brainstorming — each round has a specific focus:

**Round 1 — Obvious Hypotheses:**
For each target, write the most obvious hypothesis. The one everyone would agree with. Get it out of the way.

**Round 2 — Bold Alternatives:**
Now challenge each obvious hypothesis. What's the bold version? What if the opposite were true? What if the pain is actually a symptom of something deeper?

**Round 3 — Synthesis:**
From rounds 1 and 2, select the 1-3 strongest hypotheses to engineer as formal contracts. Strongest = most evidence-grounded AND most falsifiable.

### 2. Draft Hypothesis Contracts (4-Field Format)

For each selected hypothesis, complete the 4-field contract:

#### Hypothesis {N}: {Title}

**The 4-Field Contract:**

| Field | Your Answer |
|-------|-------------|
| **Expected Outcome** | What we expect to happen if the hypothesis is correct. Be specific and measurable — "users will engage more" is too vague. What exactly will happen? |
| **Target Behavior Change** | What specific user behavior will change, and in what direction? This must be observable and measurable. |
| **Rationale** | Why we believe this will work — grounded in evidence from the problem definition. Reference specific pains, gains, or JTBD elements. |
| **Riskiest Assumption** | The single assumption that, if wrong, invalidates the entire hypothesis. This is what must be tested first. |

**Hypothesis Statement:**

> We believe that [target users] will [expected behavior] because [rationale].

### 3. Quality Check Each Hypothesis

Before finalizing, stress-test each hypothesis:

- [ ] **Falsifiable?** Can you describe a result that would prove this hypothesis wrong? If not, sharpen it.
- [ ] **Specific?** Would two different people interpret the expected outcome the same way?
- [ ] **Evidence-grounded?** Does the rationale cite specific evidence from the problem definition, or is it gut feeling?
- [ ] **Riskiest assumption identified?** Is it truly the most lethal assumption, or the most comfortable one to test?
- [ ] **Bold enough?** Is this the safe bet, or does it push past the obvious? What's the bold version?

Let's stress-test that assumption before we build anything. If your riskiest assumption feels comfortable, it's probably not the riskiest one.

## Your Turn

Draft 1-3 hypothesis contracts using the 4-field format above. For each, include the hypothesis statement and complete the quality check. Share your drafts and I'll help sharpen them.
