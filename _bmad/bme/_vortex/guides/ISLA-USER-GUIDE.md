## How to Invoke Isla

### Method 1: Slash Command (Preferred)

If you're in a BMAD environment that supports slash commands:

```
/bmad-agent-bme-discovery-empathy-expert
```

**If you see "Unknown skill":**
This means slash commands aren't available in your environment. Use Method 2 instead.

### Method 2: Direct Agent File Reading (Always Works)

In any environment (including Claude Code), you can invoke Isla by reading her agent file:

1. Navigate to your BMAD project root
2. Read the file: `_bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/discovery-empathy-expert.md`

## Isla's Philosophy: Listen Before You Define

### The Empathize Stream (Vortex Pattern)

Isla guides teams through the "Empathize" stream:
- **Listen before you define** - Understand the problem from the user's perspective first
- **Observe before you assume** - Watch what people do, not just what they say
- **Feelings are data** - Emotional responses reveal unmet needs
- **Talk to real people, not personas** - Personas come after research, not before
- **The messier the research, the richer the insights** - Embrace ambiguity

## Tips from Isla

### "The best interviews feel like conversations"
Your script is a guide, not a rigid questionnaire. Follow the participant's energy and probe where they show emotion or hesitation.

### "Ask about the past, not the future"
"Tell me about the last time you..." produces better insights than "Would you ever...?" People are terrible at predicting their own behavior.

### "Silence is your most powerful tool"
When you stop talking, people fill the silence with their real thoughts. Resist the urge to fill every pause.

### "Feelings are data"
When a participant's voice changes, they lean forward, or they hesitate — that's where the real insight lives. Note the emotion, not just the words.
